keywords = {power grid frequency stability, probabilistic machine learning, explainable artificial intelligence, tabular data, deep learning, TabNetProba}, abstract = {Modeling power grid frequency stability is becoming increasingly challenging due to the integration of renewable energy sources. Machine learning approaches, such as gradient-boosted trees, have shown promise in analyzing the complex characteristics of power systems. However, these models are inherently deterministic, providing only point estimates. Meanwhile, the task of capturing the underlying uncertainty, particularly through (deep) probabilistic models, is still underexplored, despite its potential to better account for the stochastic nature of power grid dynamics. In this paper, we first compare the performance of TabNet, a deep learning architecture designed for tabular data, to XGBoost for modeling power grid frequency stability. We then present TabNetProba: a probabilistic extension of TabNet, that enables uncertainty-aware estimates comparable to NGBoost. Using these (trained) models, we leverage explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze the drivers influencing grid stability and identify sources of uncertainty in two major European synchronous areas: Continental Europe and the Nordic region. Our results demonstrate that TabNetProba achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while providing reliable uncertainty estimates. We find that load and conventional generation ramps, as well as forecast errors, are the key quantities for modeling and explaining mean stability indicators in both synchronous areas. In Continental Europe, renewable generation emerges as a key factor in explaining model uncertainty, while in the Nordic region, load and generation features dominate uncertainty estimation, allowing for more reliable and interpretable stability estimates for modern power systems.} }

keywords = {CatBoost, SHAP, customer churn, machine learning, telecommunication}, abstract = {In the fast-paced era of digital transformation, the telecoms industry is grappling with an increasing issue of customer churn, which endangers stable revenue and operational efficiency. This paper therefore proposes an interpretable machine learning framework that aims to identify customers who are likely to churn more accurately, while also enhancing the interpretability of the model. The performance of the model is evaluated using the publicly available Iranian churn dataset by means of data preprocessing (duplicate removal, outlier detection, feature selection and class imbalance mitigation), training of seven machine learning models tuned with hyper-parameters and selection of five key performance indicators. Experimental results demonstrate that the CatBoost model achieves excellent performance, with an accuracy of 0.9554, precision of 0.9010, recall of 0.8072, F1 score of 0.8503 and AUC-ROC of 0.9823 — surpassing the performance of the other six models. Additionally, this study explored the stacking model, which ultimately proved to be inferior to the CatBoost model. Finally, the optimal model was interpreted using the SHAP technique. The analysis identified three key characteristics affecting customer churn: seconds of use (negative correlation), call failures (positive correlation) and frequency of SMS (negative correlation). This led to the derivation of an operational strategy for customer retention in the telecommunications industry.} }
