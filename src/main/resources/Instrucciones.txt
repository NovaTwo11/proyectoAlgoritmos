Selection Bias in Machine Learning for Healthcare","normalizedText":"while machine learning algorithms hold promise for personalised medicine, their clinical adoption remains limited, partly due to biases that can compromise the reliability of predictions. in this article, we focus on sample selection bias (ssb), a specific type of bias where the study population is less representative of the target population, leading to biased and potentially harmful decisions. despite being well-known in the literature, ssb remains scarcely studied in machine learning for healthcare. moreover, the existing machine learning techniques try to correct the bias mostly by balancing distributions between the study and the target populations, which may result in a loss of predictive performance. to address these problems, our study illustrates the potential risks associated with ssb by examining ssb's impact on the performance of machine learning algorithms. most importantly, we propose a new research direction for addressing ssb, based on the target population identification rather than the bias correction. specifically, we propose two independent networks (t-net) and a multitasking network (mt-net) for addressing ssb, where one network/task identifies the target subpopulation which is representative of the study population and the second makes predictions for the identified subpopulation. our empirical results with synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets highlight that ssb can lead to a large drop in the performance of an algorithm for the target population as compared with the study population, as well as a substantial difference in the performance for the target subpopulations that are representative of the selected and the non-selected patients from the study population. furthermore, our proposed techniques demonstrate robustness across various settings, including different dataset sizes, event rates and selection rates, outperforming the existing bias

Refactoring Commits in Machine Learning Python Projects: A Machine Learning-Based Approach","normalizedText":"refactoring aims to improve the quality of software without altering its functional behaviors. understanding developers' refactoring activities is essential to improve software maintainability. the use of machine learning (ml) libraries and frameworks in software systems has significantly increased in recent years, making the maximization of their maintainability crucial. due to the data-driven nature of ml libraries and frameworks, they often undergo a different development process compared to traditional projects. as a result, they may experience various types of refactoring, such as those related to the data. the state-of-the-art refactoring detection tools have not been tested in the ml technical domain, and they are not specifically designed to detect ml-specific refactoring types (e.g., data manipulation) in ml projects; therefore, they may not adequately find all potential refactoring operations, specifically the ml-specific refactoring operations. furthermore, a vast number of ml libraries and frameworks are written in python, which has limited tooling support for refactoring detection. pyref, a rule-based and state-of-the-art tool for python refactoring detection, can identify types of refactoring operations with relatively high precision. in contrast, for other languages such as java, state-of-the-art tools are capable of detecting a much more comprehensive list of refactorings. for example, rminer can detect types of refactoring for java projects. inspired by previous work that leverages commit messages to detect refactoring, we introduce mlrefscanner, a prototype tool that applies ml techniques to detect refactoring commits in ml python projects. mlrefscanner detects commits involving both ml-specific refactoring operations and additional refactoring operations beyond the scope of state-of-the-art refactoring detection tools. to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate mlrefscanner on ml open source libraries and frameworks and compare mlrefscanner against other refactoring detection tools for python projects. our findings show that mlrefscanner outperforms existing tools in detecting refactoring-related commits, achieving an overall precision of \\\\% and recall of

when combining mlrefscanner with pyref, we can further increase the precision and recall to \\\\% and \\\\%, respectively. mlrefscanner provides a valuable contribution to the python ml community, as it allows ml developers to detect refactoring-related commits more effectively in their ml python projects. our study sheds light on the promising direction of leveraging machine learning techniques

computationally expensive to train by requiring to incorporate a large amount of public prior knowledge in terms of data or a large pre-trained model. thus, the fundamental problem of efficiently training an accurate model while preserving dp is not fully addressed. to tackle this problem, we investigate the potential of improving privacy analysis of machine learning algorithms, thus subsequently allowing improved privacy-utility trade-off. first, we observe that the standard dp bound is not tight for large, overparameterized models. specifically, the dp bound worsens with the number of iterations, and the privacy-accuracy trade-off worsens with the model dimension. this is despite the algorithm converging during training and the finite dimension of training data space. such potential untightness is more severe for a realistic adversary that does not observe all model parameters, where prior works suggest empirical privacy amplification, and we investigate theoretically. finally, we take a close look at the privacy risk of each model prediction about individual training data and analyze how to attribute privacy risk to the properties of the data and the

parameter. for (l)qte, ldml involves learning just two regression functions, a standard task for machine learning methods. we prove that under lax rate conditions our estimator has the same favorable

zettabytes by . extracting patterns and trends from such big data is crucial for enabling data-driven decision-making. however, a key challenge lies in the enormous computational costs required for large-scale analysis, due to the inherent complexities of the task. approximate methods are often employed to reduce these costs, but they inevitably trade exactness for efficiency. to overcome this limitation, our research aims to develop a machine learning platform that delivers both speed and accuracy. the core of our platform is computational pruning. this talk will introduce three representative pruning strategies. specifically, it first introduces a pruning method that uses upper and lower bounds to omit computations. this method efficiently identifies unnecessary processes by using upper and lower bounds of scores to skip unnecessary computations. next, this talk introduces a method to terminate computations that cannot yield solutions. this method maintains patterns that failed during the search process to avoid repeated futile searches. this talk finally introduces a method that prunes computations through optimistic processing. this method temporarily removes a

accuracy while meeting both real-time performance and resource constraints. tools that generate customized architectures for machine learning models, such as hls ml and finn, require manual control over latency and cost trade-offs for each layer. this poster describes a proposed end-to-end framework that combines bayesian optimization for neural architecture search with integer linear optimization of layer cost-latency trade-off using hls ml ''reuse factors''. the proposed framework is shown in fig. and consists of a performance model training phase and two model deployment stages. the performance model training phase generates training data and trains a model to predict the resource cost and latency of an hls ml deployment of a given layer and associated reuse factor on a given fpga. the first model deployment stage takes training, test, and validation data for a physical system-in this case, the dynamic reproduction of projectiles in ballistic environments for advanced research (dropbear) dataset-and searches the hyper- parameter space for pareto optimal models with respect to latency and workload, as measured by the number of multiplies required for one forward pass. for each of the models generated, a second stage uses the performance model to optimize the reuse factor of each layer to guarantee that the whole model meets the resource constraint while minimizing end-to-end latency. table shows the benefit of the reuse factor optimizer that comprises the second stage of the model deployment phase, the results compare the performance of a baseline

arcane offers a flexible isa-extension (xmnmc) abstracting memory management, effectively reducing data movement and enhancing performance. we specifically explore the acceleration capabilities of arcane when executing fundamental deep neural network (dnn) and transformer-based operations. experimental results show that, with a contained area overhead, arcane achieves consistent speedups, delivering up to improvement in d convolution, in linear layer, and over in fused-weight self-attention (fwsa), compared to conventional cpu approaches. these findings underline arcane's significant

studies indicate that traditional uncertainty metrics, such as model confidence, and performance metrics, like accuracy, are insufficient to build human trust in ml models. these models often learn spurious correlations during training and predict based on them during inference. when deployed in the real world, where such correlations are absent, their performance can deteriorate significantly. to avoid this, a common practice is to test whether predictions are made reasonably based on valid patterns in the data. along with this, a challenge known as the trustworthiness oracle problem has been introduced. so far, due to the lack of automated trustworthiness oracles, the assessment requires manual validation, based on the decision process disclosed by explanation methods. however, this approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable. to address this problem, we propose toki, the first automated trustworthiness oracle generation method for text classifiers. toki automatically checks whether the words contributing the most to a prediction are semantically related to the predicted class. specifically, we leverage ml explanation methods to extract the decision-contributing words and measure their semantic relatedness with the class based on word embeddings. as a demonstration of its practical usefulness, we also introduce a novel adversarial attack method that targets trustworthiness vulnerabilities identified by toki. we compare toki with a naive baseline based solely on model confidence. to evaluate their alignment with human judgement, experiments are conducted on human-created ground truths of approximately , predictions. additionally, we compare the effectiveness of toki-guided adversarial attack method with a t, a

bandwidth directly impacts the collective communication performance of distributed training. in this work, we exploit interconnection network sparsity (or communication sparsity) to address challenges of communication performance and scalability. in particular, we identify how gradients (or packets) during communication can be randomly skipped with minimal impact on accuracy. however, skipping gradients in fine granularity (or individually) results in a loss of gradient information without improving communication performance, due to the synchronous nature of collective communication. thus, we propose coarse-grained skipping where gradient slices are skipped, which enables skipping of some allreduce steps to accelerate communication. in particular, we propose skipreduce collective communication that intentionally skips random gradients during allreduce. however, a naive implementation of skipreduce can degrade accuracy by repeatedly skipping gradients from the same node, which introduces bias. to mitigate this accuracy loss, we show how randomizing the skipped gradient slices improves training accuracy with negligible additional runtime. we also observe that not all layers have similar communication sparsity and propose applying skipreduce selectively where only the sparse layers (or gradients) are skipped to minimize the accuracy impact of skipreduce. compared to prior work on communication acceleration, skipreduce can be seamlessly integrated into existing collective communication libraries with minimal overhead. we implement skipreduce on top of nccl's ring-based allreduce algorithm. our results show that this method accelerates collective communication while preserving final training accuracy. compared to baseline allreduce, skipreduce provides up to a . speedup in time-to-accuracy. beyond this performance gain in data parallelism, this work also discusses the broader implications of skipreduce, including its application to other parallelism

providing only point estimates. meanwhile, the task of capturing the underlying uncertainty, particularly through (deep) probabilistic models, is still underexplored, despite its potential to better account for the stochastic nature of power grid dynamics. in this paper, we first compare the performance of tabnet, a deep learning architecture designed for tabular data, to xgboost for modeling power grid frequency stability. we then present tabnetproba: a probabilistic extension of tabnet, that enables uncertainty-aware estimates comparable to ngboost. using these (trained) models, we leverage explainable artificial intelligence (xai) to analyze the drivers influencing grid stability and identify sources of uncertainty in two major european synchronous areas: continental europe and the nordic region. our results demonstrate that tabnetproba achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while providing reliable uncertainty estimates. we find that load and conventional generation ramps, as well as forecast errors, are the key quantities for modeling and explaining mean stability indicators in both synchronous areas. in continental europe, renewable

our framework strategically positions prominent contemporary digital learning resources (cdlrs) --- high-quality resources created by professionals for adult learners --- at the center of instruction,

A Machine Learning-Guided Panel Review System for Community Content Moderation","normalizedText":"research into community content moderation often assumes that moderation teams govern with a single, unified voice. however, recent work has found that moderators disagree with one another at modest, but concerning rates. the problem is not the root disagreements themselves. subjectivity in moderation is unavoidable, and there are clear benefits to including diverse perspectives within a moderation team. instead, the crux of the issue is that, due to resource constraints, moderation decisions end up being made by individual decision-makers. the result is decision-making that is inconsistent, which is frustrating for community members. to address this, we develop venire, an ml-backed system for panel review on reddit. venire uses a machine learning model trained on log data to identify the cases where moderators are most likely to disagree. venire fast-tracks these cases for multi-person review. ideally, venire allows moderators to surface and resolve disagreements that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. we conduct three studies through which we design and evaluate venire: a set of formative interviews with moderators, technical evaluations on two datasets, and a think-aloud study in which moderators used venire to make decisions on real moderation cases. quantitatively, we demonstrate that venire is able to improve decision consistency and surface latent disagreements. qualitatively, we find that venire helps moderators resolve difficult moderation cases more confidently. venire represents a novel paradigm for human-ai content moderation, and shifts the conversation from replacing human decision-making to supporting it.","tokens":["research","community","content","moderation","often","assumes","moderation","teams","govern","single","unified","voice","however","recent","work","found","moderators","disagree","one","another","modest","but","concerning","rates","problem","not","root","disagreements","themselves","subjectivity","moderation","unavoidable","there","clear","benefits","including","diverse","perspectives","within","moderation","team","instead","crux","issue","due","resource","constraints","moderation","decisions","end","being","made","individual","decision","makers","decision","making","inconsistent","which","frustrating","community","members","address","develop","venire","backed","system","panel","review","reddit","venire","uses","machine","learning","model","trained","log","identify","cases","where","moderators","most","likely","disagree","venire","fast","tracks","cases","multi","person","review","ideally","venire","allows","moderators","surface","resolve","disagreements","would","otherwise","gone","unnoticed","conduct","three","studies","through","which","design","evaluate","venire","set","formative","interviews","moderators","technical","evaluations","two","datasets","think","aloud","which","moderators","venire","make","decisions","real","moderation","cases","quantitatively","demonstrate","venire","able","improve","decision","consistency","surface","latent","disagreements","qualitatively","venire","helps","moderators","resolve","difficult","moderation","cases","more","confidently","venire","represents","novel","paradigm","human","content","moderation","shifts","conversation","replacing","human","decision","making","supporting"]},{"id":"10.1145/3724154.3724247","title":"Bankruptcy

Machine Learning Pipelines Produced by Evolutionary AutoML for Biochemical Property Prediction","normalizedText":"machine learning (ml) has been playing a crucial role in drug discovery, mainly through quantitative structure-activity relationship models that relate molecular structures to properties, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (admet) properties. however, traditional ml approaches often lack customisation to a particular biochemical task and fail to generalise to new biochemical spaces, resulting in reduced predictive performance. automated machine learning (automl) has emerged to address these limitations by automatically selecting the suitable ml pipelines for a given input dataset. despite its potential, automl is underutilised in cheminformatics, and its decisions often lack interpretability, reducing user trust - especially among non-experts. accordingly, this paper proposes an evolutionary automl method for biochemical

qubits within the compiler to facilitate the execution of two-qubit gates in the algorithm. however, this introduces additional operations, consequently reducing the fidelity of the algorithm. therefore, minimizing the number of added gates becomes crucial. finding such an optimal routing problem is np-hard, and the task is conventionally addressed using human-crafted heuristics to search for swap sequences, but these lack performance guarantees. in this study, we employ a seq seq machine learning model for the qubit routing task, incorporating a transformer neural network to learn the

advanced wireless (aerpaw) geofence area, located in raleigh, north carolina, usa. by adopting the clustering strategy, our primary goal is to reduce flight time without compromising the high signal-to-noise ratio (snr) across trajectories. our proposed model also tackles the challenge of dynamic hovering time adjustment at each waypoint by incorporating an adaptive approach based on instantaneous link quality and data volume. to validate the proposed data collection model, we utilize a digital twin simulation environment from aerpaw. the results emulated over the aerpaw's digital twin demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring enhanced efficiency in the uav-aided fast data collection strategy.","tokens":["unmanned","aerial","vehicles","uavs","emerged","essential","components","beyond","networks","particularly","uavs","serve","aerial","mules","capable","efficiently","collecting","transferring","geographically","dispersed","ground","nodes","such","ground","base","stations","however","practical","limitations","like","battery","life","constraints","stringent","mission","timeliness","varying","wireless","conditions","present","significant","challenges","efficient","collection","reduce","mission","completion","time","optimizing","uav","trajectory","often","considered","primary","challenge","addition","collection","time","under","hovering","mode","also","greatly","affect","mission","time","work","propose","machine","learning","uav","aided","collection","model","leverages","means","clustering","identify","optimal","waypoints","near","each","base","station","within","aerial","experimentation","research","platform","advanced","wireless","aerpaw","geofence","area","located","raleigh","north","carolina","usa","adopting","clustering","strategy","primary","goal","reduce","flight","time","without","compromising","high","signal","noise","ratio","snr","trajectories","proposed","model","also","tackles","challenge","dynamic","hovering","time","adjustment","each","waypoint","incorporating","adaptive","instantaneous","link","quality","volume","validate","proposed","collection","model","utilize","digital","twin","simulation","environment","aerpaw","emulated","over","aerpaw","digital","twin","demonstrate","effectiveness","proposed","algorithm","ensuring","enhanced","efficiency","uav","aided","fast","collection","strategy"]},{"id":"10.1145/3672608.3707756","title":"A

isolate and quantify the noises that are not captured by the tcad models but exist in the measured data due to measurements and devices variabilities. lastly, the calibrated surrogate models are used

Machine Learning Meets Multi-Table Relational Data","normalizedText":"while graph machine learning, and notably graph neural networks (gnns), have gained immense traction in recent years, application is predicated on access to a known input graph upon which predictive models can be trained. and indeed, within the most widely-studied public evaluation benchmarks such graphs are provided, with performance comparisons conditioned on curated data explicitly adhering to this graph. however, in real-world industrial applications, the situation is often quite different. instead of a known graph, data are originally collected and stored across multiple tables in a repository, at times with ambiguous or incomplete relational structure. as such, to leverage the latest gnn architectures it is then up to a skilled data scientist to first manually construct a graph using intuition and domain knowledge, a laborious process that may discourage adoption in the first place. to narrow this gap and broaden the applicability of graph ml, we survey existing tools and strategies that can be combined to address the more fundamental problem of predictive tabular modeling over data native to multiple tables, with no explicit relational structure assumed a priori. this involves tracing a comprehensive path through related table join discovery and fuzzy table joining, column alignment, automated relational database (rdb) construction, extracting graphs from rdbs, graph sampling, and finally, graph-centric trainable predictive architectures. although efforts to build deployable systems that integrate all of these components while minimizing manual effort remain in their infancy, this survey will nonetheless reduce barriers to entry and help steer the graph ml community

counterfactual explanations, a specific class of explanation that provides a link between what could have happened had input to a model been changed in a particular way. modern approaches to counterfactual explainability in machine learning draw connections to the established legal doctrine in many countries, making them appealing to fielded systems in high-impact areas such as finance and healthcare. thus, we design a rubric with desirable properties of counterfactual explanation algorithms and comprehensively evaluate all currently proposed algorithms against that rubric. our rubric provides easy comparison and comprehension of the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches and serves as an introduction to major research themes in this field. we also identify gaps and discuss promising research directions in the space of counterfactual explainability.","tokens":["machine","learning","plays","role","many","deployed","decision","systems","often","ways","difficult","impossible","understand","human","stakeholders","explaining","human","understandable","way","relationship","between","input","output","machine","learning","models","essential","development","trustworthy","machine","learning","systems","burgeoning","body","research","seeks","define","goals","explainability","machine","learning","article","seek","review","categorize","research","counterfactual","explanations","specific","class","explanation","provides","link","between","what","happened","input","model","been","changed","particular","way","modern","counterfactual","explainability","machine","learning","draw","connections","established","legal","doctrine","many","countries","making","them","appealing","fielded","systems","high","impact","areas","such","finance","healthcare","thus","design","rubric","desirable","properties","counterfactual","explanation","algorithms","comprehensively","evaluate","all","currently","proposed","algorithms","against","rubric","rubric","provides","easy","comparison","comprehension","advantages","disadvantages","different","serves","introduction","major","research","themes","field","also","identify","gaps","discuss","promising","research","directions","space","counterfactual","explainability"]},{"id":"10.1145/3600211.3604753","title":"Advancing

interaction (phri), a key focus of our research. we use a machine learning (ml) classifier to detect conflicts during co-manipulation tasks to adapt the robot's behavior accordingly using an admittance controller. in our approach, we focus on two groups of interactions, namely \"harmonious\" and \"conflicting,\" corresponding respectively to the cases of the human and the robot working in harmony to transport an object when they aim for the same target, and human and robot are in conflict when human changes the manipulation plan, e.g. due to a change in the direction of movement or parking location of the object.co-manipulation scenarios were designed to investigate the efficacy of the proposed ml approach, involving participants. task performance achieved by the ml approach was compared against three alternative approaches: (a) a rule-based (rb) approach, where interaction behaviors were rule-derived from statistical distributions of haptic features; (b) an unyielding robot that is proactive during harmonious interactions but does not resolve conflicts otherwise, and (c) a passive robot which always follows the human partner. this mode of cooperation is known as \"hand guidance\" in phri literature and is frequently used in industrial settings for so-called \"teaching\" a trajectory to a collaborative robot.the results show that the proposed ml approach is superior to the others in task performance. however, a detailed questionnaire administered after the experiments, which contains several metrics, covering a spectrum of dimensions to measure the subjective opinion of the participants, reveals that the most preferred mode of interaction with the robot is surprisingly passive. this preference indicates a strong inclination toward an interaction mode that gives more control to humans and offers less demanding interaction, even if it is not the most efficient in task performance. hence, there is a clear trade-off between task performance and the preferred mode of interaction of humans with a robot, and a well-balanced approach is necessary for designing effective phri systems in the

recommendability of victim items? can a malicious user poison or evade the image data of visual recommenders with adversarial perturbed product images? is the family of model-based recommenders more vulnerable to multi-step gradient-based adversarial perturbations? furthermore, is the adversarial training robustification still effective in the last scenario? is this training defense influencing the beyond-accuracy and bias performance?this dissertation intends to pave the way towards more robust recommender systems, beginning with understanding how to robustify a model, what is the cost of robustness in terms of reduction of recommendation accuracy, and which are the novel adversarial risks of modern recommenders. this thesis, getting inspiration from the literature on the security of collaborative models against the insertion of hand-engineered fake profiles and the recent advances of adversarial machine learning methods in other research areas like computer vision, contributes to several directions: (i) the proposal of a practical framework to interpret the impact of data characteristics on the robustness of collaborative recommenders [deldjoo et al., ], (ii) the design of

collected from heterogeneous sources and processed on vast networks of computing devices (also called workers). beyond accuracy, the use of ml in critical domains such as healthcare and autonomous driving calls for robustness against data poisoning and faulty workers. the problem of byzantine ml formalizes these robustness issues by considering a distributed ml environment in which workers (storing a portion of the global dataset) can deviate arbitrarily from the prescribed algorithm. although the problem has attracted a lot of attention from a theoretical point of view, its practical importance for addressing realistic faults (where the behavior of any worker is locally constrained) remains unclear. it has been argued that the seemingly weaker threat model where only workers' local datasets get poisoned is more reasonable. we highlight here some important results on the efficacy of byzantine robustness for tackling data poisoning. in particular, we discuss cases where, while tolerating a wider range of faulty behaviors, byzantine ml yields solutions that are optimal even under the weaker threat model of data

the community lacks a systematic understanding of their robustness.in this paper, we aim to systematically test and understand the deviation behaviors of he-ml models, where the same input causes deviant outputs between fhe-hardened models and their plaintext versions, leading to completely incorrect model predictions. to effectively uncover deviation-triggering inputs under the constraints of expensive fhe computations, we design a novel differential testing tool called hediff, which leverages the margin metric on the plaintext model as guidance to drive targeted testing on fhe models. for the identified deviation inputs, we further analyze them to determine whether they exhibit general noise patterns that are transferable. we evaluate hediff using three popular he-ml frameworks, covering different combinations of models and datasets. hediff successfully detected hundreds of deviation inputs across almost every tested fhe framework and model. we also quantitatively show that the identified deviation inputs are (visually) meaningful in comparison to regular inputs. further schematic analysis reveals the root cause of these deviant inputs and allows us to generalize their noise patterns for more directed testing. our work sheds light on enabling robust he-ml for real-world usage.","tokens":["fully","homomorphic","encryption","fhe","promising","cryptographic","primitive","enables","secure","computation","over","encrypted","primary","fhe","support","privacy","preserving","machine","learning","public","cloud","infrastructures","despite","rapid","development","fhe","community","lacks","systematic","understanding","robustness","aim","systematically","test","understand","deviation","behaviors","models","where","same","input","causes","deviant","outputs","between","fhe","hardened","models","plaintext","versions","leading","completely","incorrect","model","predictions","effectively","uncover","deviation","triggering","inputs","under","constraints","expensive","fhe","computations","design","novel","differential","testing","tool","called","hediff","which","leverages","margin","metric","plaintext","model","guidance","drive","targeted","testing","fhe","models","identified","deviation","inputs","further","analyze","them","determine","whether","they","exhibit","general","noise","patterns","transferable","evaluate","hediff","three","popular","frameworks","covering","different","combinations","models","datasets","hediff","successfully","detected","hundreds","deviation","inputs","almost","every","tested","fhe","framework","model","also","quantitatively","identified","deviation","inputs","visually","meaningful","comparison","regular","inputs","further","schematic","analysis","reveals","root","cause","deviant","inputs","allows","generalize","noise","patterns","more","directed","testing","work","sheds","light","enabling","robust","real","world","usage"]},{"id":"10.1145/3703790.3703801","title":"Sensor-Guided

individual losses. the resulting framework has several useful properties: we show that term can increase or decrease the influence of outliers, respectively, to enable fairness or robustness; has variance-reduction properties that can benefit generalization; and can be viewed as a smooth approximation to the tail probability of losses. our work makes connections between term and related objectives, such as value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, and distributionally robust optimization (dro). we develop batch and stochastic first-order optimization methods for solving term, provide convergence guarantees for the solvers, and show that the framework can be efficiently solved relative to common alternatives. finally, we demonstrate that term can be used for a multitude of applications in machine learning, such as enforcing fairness between subgroups, mitigating the effect of outliers, and handling class imbalance. despite the straightforward modification term makes to traditional erm objectives, we find that the framework can consistently outperform erm and deliver competitive performance with state-of-the-art, problem-specific approaches.","tokens":["exponential","tilting","technique","commonly","fields","such","statistics","probability","information","theory","optimization","create","parametric","distribution","shifts","despite","prevalence","related","fields","tilting","not","seen","widespread","machine","learning","work","aim","bridge","gap","exploring","tilting","risk","minimization","simple","extension","erm","tilted","empirical","risk","minimization","term","which","uses","exponential","tilting","flexibly","tune","impact","individual","losses","resulting","framework","several","useful","properties","term","increase","decrease","influence","outliers","respectively","enable","fairness","robustness","variance","reduction","properties","benefit","generalization","viewed","smooth","approximation","tail","probability","losses","work","makes","connections","between","term","related","objectives","such","value","risk","conditional","value","risk","distributionally","robust","optimization","dro","develop","batch","stochastic","first","order","optimization","solving","term","provide","convergence","guarantees","solvers","framework","efficiently","solved","relative","common","alternatives","finally","demonstrate","term","multitude","applications","machine","learning","such","enforcing","fairness","between","subgroups","mitigating","effect","outliers","handling","class","imbalance","despite","straightforward","modification","term","makes","traditional","erm","objectives","framework","consistently","outperform","erm","deliver","competitive","performance","state","art","problem","specific"]},{"id":"10.1145/3620666.3651367","title":"ProxiML:

A Runtime Fuzz-based Machine Learning Precision Measurement and Testing Framework","normalizedText":"the rapid evolution of machine learning model training has outpaced the development of corresponding measurement and testing tools, leading to two significant challenges. firstly, developers of deep learning frameworks struggle to identify operators that fail to meet precision criteria, as these issues may only manifest in a few data points. secondly, model trainers lack effective methods to estimate precision loss caused by operators during training. to address these issues, we introduce a pythonic framework inspired by common network layer definitions in deep learning. our framework includes two new layers: the fuzz layer and the check layer, designed to aid in measurement and testing. the fuzz layer introduces minor perturbations to tensor inputs for any deterministic layer under testing (lut). the check layer then measures precision by analyzing the differences before and after the perturbation. this approach estimates a lower bound of the maximal relative error and alerts developers or trainers of potential bugs if the difference exceeds a predefined tolerance. additionally, check layers can be used independently to conduct precision tests for specific layers, ensuring the precision of operators during runtime. despite the additional memory and time requirements, this runtime testing ensures proper training of the original model. we demonstrate the utility of our framework, fumi, through two experiments. first, we tested torch operators across popular machine learning models using pytorch for various tasks, finding that the conv d and linear operators often fail to meet precision requirements. second, to showcase the generalizability of our framework, we tested the attention operator. by comparing different implementations of state-of-the-art attention operators, we found that the maximum relative error of the attention operator is not

faced with deciding whether a given function makes the program vulnerable to attacks, we would often first want to understand the context in which this function is called. in this paper, we study how often this decision can really be made without further context and study both vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions in the most popular ml vd datasets. we call a function vulnerable if it was involved in a patch of an actual security flaw and confirmed to cause the program's vulnerability. it is non-vulnerable otherwise. we find that in almost all cases this decision cannot be made without further context. vulnerable functions are often vulnerable only because a corresponding vulnerability-inducing calling context exists while non-vulnerable functions would often be vulnerable if a corresponding context existed. but why do ml vd techniques achieve high scores even though there is demonstrably not enough information in these samples? spurious correlations: we find that high scores can be achieved even when only word counts are available. this shows that these datasets can be exploited to achieve high scores without actually detecting any security vulnerabilities. we conclude that the prevailing problem statement of ml vd is ill-defined and call into question the internal validity of this growing body of work. constructively, we call for more effective

and types of hardware platforms that machine learning (ml) libraries must support. high-level programming interfaces, such as tensorflow, can be readily ported across different devices; however, maintaining performance when porting the low-level implementation is more nuanced. high-performance inference implementations require an effective mapping of the high-level interface to the target hardware platform. commonly, this mapping may use optimizing compilers to generate code at compile time or high-performance vendor libraries that have been specialized to the target platform. both approaches rely on expert knowledge across levels to produce an efficient mapping. this makes supporting new architectures difficult and time-consuming.in this work, we present a dnn library framework, small, that is easily extensible to new architectures. the framework uses a unified loop structure and shared, cache-friendly data format across all intermediate layers, eliminating the time and memory overheads incurred by data transformation between layers. each layer is implemented by specifying its dimensions and a kernel, the key computing operation of that layer. the unified loop structure and kernel abstraction allows the reuse of code across layers and computing platforms. new architectures only require a few hundred lines in the kernel to be redesigned. to show the benefits of our approach, we have developed software that supports a range of layer types and computing platforms; this software is easily extensible for rapidly instantiating high-performance dnn

a small, maliciously crafted subset of the training inputs can cause the model to learn a \"backdoor\" task (e.g., misclassify inputs with a certain feature) in addition to its main task. recent research proposed many hypothetical backdoor attacks whose efficacy depends on the configuration and training hyperparameters of the target model. at the same time, state-of-the-art defenses require massive changes to the existing ml pipelines and protect only against some attacks.given the variety of potential backdoor attacks, ml engineers who are not security experts have no way to measure how vulnerable their current training pipelines are, nor do they have a practical way to compare training configurations so as to pick the more resistant ones. deploying a defense may not be a realistic option, either. it requires evaluating and choosing from among dozens of research papers, completely re-engineering the pipeline as required by the chosen defense, and then repeating the process if the defense disrupts normal model training (while providing theoretical protection against an unknown subset of hypothetical threats).in this paper, we aim to provide ml engineers with pragmatic tools to audit the backdoor resistance of their training pipelines and to compare different training configurations, to help choose the one that best balances accuracy and security.first, we propose a universal, attack-agnostic resistance metric based on the minimum number of training inputs that must be compromised before the model learns any backdoor.second, we design, implement, and evaluate mithridates, a multi-stage approach that integrates backdoor resistance into the training-configuration search. ml developers already rely on hyperparameter search to find configurations that maximize the model's accuracy. mithridates extends this tool to also order configurations based on their backdoor resistance. we demonstrate that mithridates discovers configurations whose resistance to multiple types of backdoor attacks increases by - x with only a slight impact on accuracy. we also discuss extensions to automl and federated

data, which are not typically available. to overcome this, various techniques, such as fault injection or intrusion injection, have been proposed to generate realistic data. still, they are computationally expensive and require considerable expertise. at the same time, a recent growing sub-field of ml is generative models. generative models offer an innovative solution by creating synthetic data that closely resemble real-world samples. if such models could be used to generate realistic synthetic failure or intrusion data on demand, their value would be significant. notwithstanding, the feasibility of such an approach has not yet been researched. generative models have only mostly been used for sequential data (e.g., text or music) or data with high spatial dependency (e.g., images). on the other hand, dependability problems often have high dimensional tabular data, for which generative models are yet to excel, and for which it is also considerably more

widely used to solve real-world multi-objective optimization problems, aiming to obtain a set of non-dominated solutions close to the pareto front. however, most emo methods assume deterministic decision variables, ignoring inherent uncertainties in engineering applications, which can lead to design failures, especially in reliability-based designs. reliability-based multi-objective optimization (remoo) addresses this issue by incorporating variable uncertainty and probabilistic constraints to generate a reliable front. remoo operates using a bi-level framework: the outer level optimizes objective functions, while the inner level estimates reliability through computationally intensive methods, like monte carlo simulation (mcs) or the performance measure approach (pma). additionally, decision-makers (dms) often select only a subset of reliable solutions, limiting computational efficiency. to overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a machine learning-assisted reliability-based multi-criteria decision-making (ml-remcdm) technique. ml models are trained on reliability-based constraints within the decision space before an emo execution. in the inner loop, ml models predict probabilistic constraints and reliability indices, significantly reducing computational costs. moreover, the outer loop computes only the dm-preferred segment of the reliable front, further enhancing efficiency. the ml-remcdm approach, implemented on several benchmark and real-world examples, demonstrates substantial improvements in computational efficiency as well as practical

challenges to fpga and ml researchers. existing datasets either cover only a subset of previously published benchmarks, provide no way to enumerate optimization design spaces, are limited to a specific vendor, or have no reproducible and extensible software for dataset construction. many works also lack user-friendly ways to add more designs to existing datasets, limiting wider adoption and sustainability of such datasets.in response to these challenges, we introduce hlsfactory, a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the curation and generation of high-quality hls design datasets. hlsfactory has three main stages: ) a design space expansion stage to elaborate single hls designs into large design spaces using various optimization directives across multiple vendor tools, ) a design synthesis stage to execute hls and fpga tool flows concurrently across designs, and ) a data aggregation stage for extracting standardized data into packaged datasets for ml usage. this tripartite architecture not only ensures broad coverage of data points via design space expansion but also supports interoperability with tools from multiple vendors. users can contribute to each stage easily by submitting their own hls designs or synthesis results via provided user apis. the framework is also flexible, allowing extensions at every step via user apis with custom frontends, synthesis tools, and scripts.to demonstrate the framework functionality, we include an initial set of built-in base designs from polybench, machsuite, rosetta, chstone, kastner et al.'s parallel programming for fpgas, and curated kernels from existing open-source hls designs. we report the statistical analyses and design space visualizations to demonstrate the completed end-to-end compilation flow, and to highlight the effectiveness of our design space expansion beyond the initial base dataset, which greatly contributes to dataset diversity and coverage.in addition to its evident application in ml, we showcase the versatility and multi-functionality of our framework through seven case studies:i) building an ml model for post-implementation qor predictionii) using design space sampling in stage to expand the design space covered from a small base set of hls designs; iii) demonstrating the speedup from the fine-grained design parallelism backend; iv) extending hlsfactory to target intel's hls flow across all stages; v) adding and running new auxiliary designs using hlsfactory; vi) integration of previously published hls data in stage ; vii) using hlsfactory to perform

as a matter of 'organizational alignment': what makes research 'doable' is the successful alignment of three levels of work organization (the social world, the laboratory, and the experiment). based on qualitative interviews with cs researchers, we analyze the tasks, resources, and actors required for doable research in the case of fair ai. we find that cs researchers engage with soi research to some extent, but organizational conditions, articulation work, and ambiguities of the social world constrain the doability of soi research for them. based on our findings, we identify and discuss problems for aligning cs and soi as fair ai continues to evolve.","tokens":["field","fair","aims","counter","biased","algorithms","through","computational","modelling","however","faces","increasing","criticism","perpetuating","overly","technical","reductionist","novel","appear","field","address","more","socially","oriented","interdisciplinary","soi","perspectives","fair","take","dynamic","starting","point","tension","between","computer","science","soi","research","drawing","sts","cscw","theory","position","fair","research","matter","organizational","alignment","what","makes","research","doable","successful","alignment","three","levels","work","organization","social","world","laboratory","experiment","qualitative","interviews","researchers","analyze","tasks","resources","actors","required","doable","research","case","fair","researchers","engage","soi","research","some","extent","but","organizational","conditions","articulation","work","ambiguities","social","world","constrain","doability","soi","research","them","findings","identify","discuss","problems","aligning","soi","fair","continues","evolve"]},{"id":"10.1145/3724154.3724317","title":"A

Is the Point of Equality in Machine Learning Fairness? Beyond Equality of Opportunity","normalizedText":"fairness in machine learning (ml) has become a rapidly growing area of research. but why, in the first place, is unfairness in ml wrong? and why should we care about improving fairness? most fair-ml research implicitly appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable benefits and goods, such as opportunities (e.g., barocas et al., ), should be equally distributed across society. unfair ml models, then, are seen as wrong because they unequally distribute such benefits. this paper argues that this exclusive focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading ethical foundation, especially in the context of text- and image-generation models. grounding ml fairness in egalitarianism-the view that equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal-requires challenging structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. structural inequality manifests through ml systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g., economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). while distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why representational harms are wrong-that is, why it is wrong for ml systems to reinforce social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups-and why ml systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals (i.e., relational equality). to address these limitations, the paper proposes a novel multifaceted egalitarian framework for ml fairness that integrates both distributive and relational notions of equality. drawing on critical social and political philosophy, including the work of anderson, young, and fraser, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ml systems. the paper also outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the entire ml pipeline.","tokens":["fairness","machine","learning","become","rapidly","growing","area","research","but","why","first","place","unfairness","wrong","why","should","care","about","improving","fairness","most","fair","research","implicitly","appeals","distributive","equality","idea","desirable","benefits","goods","such","opportunities","barocas","should","equally","distributed","society","unfair","models","then","seen","wrong","because","they","unequally","distribute","such","benefits","argues","exclusive","focus","distributive","equality","offers","incomplete","potentially","misleading","ethical","foundation","especially","context","text","image","generation","models","grounding","fairness","egalitarianism","view","equality","fundamental","moral","social","ideal","requires","challenging","structural","inequality","systematic","institutional","durable","arrangements","privilege","some","groups","while","disadvantaging","others","structural","inequality","manifests","through","systems","two","primary","forms","allocative","harms","economic","loss","representational","harms","stereotypes","erasure","while","distributive","equality","helps","address","allocative","harms","fails","explain","why","representational","harms","wrong","why","wrong","systems","reinforce","social","hierarchies","stratify","people","superior","inferior","groups","why","systems","should","aim","foster","society","where","people","relate","equals","relational","equality","address","limitations","proposes","novel","multifaceted","egalitarian","framework","fairness","integrates","both","distributive","relational","notions","equality","drawing","critical","social","political","philosophy","including","work","anderson","young","fraser","framework","offers","more","comprehensive","ethical","foundation","tackling","full","spectrum","harms","perpetuated","systems","also","outlines","practical","pathways","implementing","framework","entire","pipeline"]},{"id":"10.1145/3675888.3676144","title":"Automated

computing, the security of qml models is of prime importance, particularly against reverse engineering, which could expose sensitive parameters and proprietary algorithms embedded within the models. we assume the untrusted third-party quantum cloud provider is an adversary having white-box access to the transpiled version of the user-designed trained qml model during inference. although the adversary can steal and use the model without any modification, reverse engineering (re) to extract the pre-transpiled copy of the qml circuit will enable re-transpilation and usage of the model for various hardware with completely different native gate sets and even different qubit technology. the information about the parameters (e.g., number of parameters, their placements, and optimized values) can allow further training of the qml model if the adversary plans to alter the qml model to tamper with the watermark and/or embed their own watermark or refine the model for other purposes. in this first effort to investigate the re of qml circuits, we examine quantum classifiers by comparing the training accuracy of original and reverse-engineered models across various sizes (i.e., number of qubits and number of parametric layers) of quantum neural networks (qnns). we note that multi-qubit classifiers can be reverse-engineered under specific conditions with a mean error of order

considered. an unrealistic setting was used in almost the entire area by assuming that the number of labels of each test instance is known in the prediction stage. in practice, such ground truth

users can do whatever the best setting on all the available labeled data (i.e., training and validation sets combined). through real stories, we show that many did not clearly see the relation between

of cutting-edge network optimization techniques to react agilely to the ever-changing traffic demands of dml jobs.this paper proposes netjit, a novel program-behavior-aware toolkit for accurately foreseeing the traffic pattern of dml. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing the use of just-in-time (jit) program analysis for real-time traffic measurement. in dml applications, communication behavior is primarily determined by the previously computed results. netjit leverages this characteristic to anticipate communication details by tracing and analyzing the data relations in the computation process. this capability enables the deployment of optimization strategies in advance.we deploy netjit in real-world network optimization for traffic preknowledge. evaluation with the self-built testbed prototype demonstrates that netjit can achieve up to about \\\\% less error of detecting communication events compared with other methods. simulations with

uses the data from the heuristic scheduling method for training a deep reinforcement learning (rl) model. after the rl model is well trained, it then switches to the rl method to automatically make decisions on job scheduling. in addition, mlfs has a system load control method that selects tasks from overloaded servers to move to underloaded servers based on task priority, and also intelligently removes the tasks that generate little or no improvement on the desired accuracy performance when the system is overloaded to improve jct and accuracy by job deadline. furthermore, we propose optimal

cleaning primitives, and ml applications; automatically generates hybrid runtime plans of local and distributed operations; and performs pruning by interesting properties (e.g., monotonicity). furthermore, we exploit guided sampling on the input dataset to enable enumeration on a smaller subset, reducing the time required to discover the top-k pipelines. as a post-processing step, we also perform pipeline pruning on the selected top-k pipelines, removing redundant and less effective cleaning primitives. instead of full automation-which is rather unrealistic-saga++ simplifies the mechanical aspects of data cleaning. our experiments show that saga++ yields robust accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art, and good scalability regarding increasing data sizes and number of

the international function points user group (ifpug) has adopted the \"high-level fpa\" method (also known as the nesma method). this method avoids weighting each data and transaction function by using fixed weights instead. applying high-level fpa, or similar estimation methods, is faster and easier than carrying out the official measurement process but inevitably yields an approximation in the measures. in this article, we contribute to the problem of estimating software functional size measures by using machine learning. to the best of our knowledge, machine learning methods were never applied to the early estimation of software functional size. our goal is to understand whether machine learning techniques yield estimates of fpa measures that are more accurate than those obtained with high-level fpa or similar methods. an empirical study on a large dataset of functional size predictors was carried out to train and test three of the most popular and robust machine learning methods, namely random forests, support vector regression\\\\&nbsp;, and neural networks. a systematic experimental phase, with cycles of dataset filtering and splitting, parameter tuning, and model

sharing their ml model. fully homomorphic encryption (fhe) is a promising technique to enable individuals using ml services without giving up privacy and protecting the ml model of service providers at the same time. despite steady improvements, fhe is still hardly integrated in today's ml applications. reasons for that are, among others, that existing implementations either require the user to possess expertise in fhe, do not feature an easy ml framework integration, or have to approximate non-polynomial activations. we introduce he-man, an open-source two-party machine learning toolset for privacy preserving inference with onnx models and homomorphically encrypted data. both the model and the input data do not have to be disclosed. he-man abstracts cryptographic details away from the

Holistic Evaluation of Differentially Private Machine Learning","normalizedText":"differential privacy (dp), as a rigorous mathematical definition quantifying privacy leakage, has become a well-accepted standard for privacy protection. combined with powerful machine learning (ml) techniques, differentially private machine learning (dpml) is increasingly important. as the most classic dpml algorithm, dp-sgd incurs a significant loss of utility, which hinders dpml's deployment in practice. many studies have recently proposed improved algorithms based on dp-sgd to mitigate utility loss. however, these studies are isolated and cannot comprehensively measure the performance of improvements proposed in algorithms. more importantly, there is a lack of comprehensive research to compare improvements in these dpml algorithms across utility, defensive capabilities, and generalizability.we fill this gap by performing a holistic measurement of improved dpml algorithms on utility and defense capability against membership inference attacks (mias) on image classification tasks. we first present a taxonomy of where improvements are located in the ml life cycle. based on our taxonomy, we jointly perform an extensive measurement study of the improved dpml algorithms, over twelve algorithms, four model architectures, four datasets, two attacks, and various privacy budget configurations. we also cover state-of-the-art label differential privacy (label dp) algorithms in the evaluation. according to our empirical results, dp can effectively defend against mias, and sensitivity-bounding techniques such as per-sample gradient clipping play an important role in defense. we also explore some improvements that can maintain model utility and defend against mias more effectively. experiments show that label dp algorithms achieve less utility loss but are fragile to mias. ml practitioners may benefit from these evaluations to select appropriate algorithms. to support our evaluation, we implement a modular re-usable software, dpmlbench, . we open-source the tool in which enables sensitive data owners to deploy dpml algorithms and serves as a benchmark tool

in machine learning as data curation practices. to do so, we develop a framework for evaluating machine learning datasets using data curation concepts and principles through a rubric. through a mixed-methods analysis of evaluation results for ml datasets, we study the feasibility of data curation principles to be adopted for machine learning data work in practice and explore how data curation is currently performed. we find that researchers in machine learning, which often emphasizes model development, struggle to apply standard data curation principles. our findings illustrate difficulties at the intersection of these fields, such as evaluating dimensions that have shared terms in both fields but non-shared meanings, a high degree of interpretative flexibility in adapting concepts without prescriptive restrictions, obstacles in limiting the depth of data curation expertise needed to apply the rubric, and challenges in scoping the extent of documentation dataset

Data Acquisition to Enhance Machine Learning Performance","normalizedText":"in this paper, we study how to acquire labeled data points from a large data pool to enrich a training set for enhancing supervised machine learning (ml) performance. the state-of-the-art solution is the clustering-based training set selection (cts) algorithm, which initially clusters the data points in a data pool and subsequently selects new data points from clusters. the efficiency of cts is constrained by its frequent retraining of the target ml model, and the effectiveness is limited by the selection criteria, which represent the state of data points within each cluster and impose a restriction of selecting only one cluster in each iteration. to overcome these limitations, we propose a new algorithm, called cts with incremental estimation of adaptive score (ias). ias employs online learning, enabling incremental model updates by using new data, and eliminating the need to fully retrain the target model, and hence improves the efficiency. to enhance the effectiveness of ias, we introduce adaptive score estimation, which serves as novel selection criteria to identify clusters and select new data points by balancing trade-offs between exploitation and exploration during data acquisition. to further enhance the effectiveness of ias, we introduce a new adaptive mini-batch selection method that, in each iteration, selects data points from multiple clusters rather than a single cluster, hence eliminating the potential bias due to using only one cluster. by integrating this method into the ias algorithm, we propose a novel algorithm termed ias with adaptive mini-batch selection (ias-ams). experimental results highlight the superior effectiveness of ias-ams, with ias also outperforming other competing algorithms. in terms of efficiency, ias takes the lead, while the efficiency of ias-ams is on par with that of the existing cts

machine learning (ml) models, in particular long short term memory (lstm) neural networks, have been proposed by various works, for their improved predictive capabilities. following this trend, we train lstm models and observe high levels of prediction accuracy, even on unseen data. upon meticulous visual inspection of the results, we notice that although the predicted values seem highly accurate, they are nothing but versions of the original data shifted by one time step into the future. yet, this clear shift seems to be enough to produce a robust forecast, because the values are highly correlated across time. we investigate time series data of various resource usage metrics (cpu, memory, network, disk i/o) across different cloud providers and levels, such as at the physical or virtual machine-level and at the application job-level. we observe that resource utilization displays very small variations in consecutive time steps. this insight can enable very simple solutions, such as data shifts, to be used for cloud resource forecasting and deliver highly accurate predictions. this is the reason why we ask whether complex machine learning models are even necessary to use.

although conventional design automation coupled with ip and platform reuse techniques have led to leaps in design productivity improvement, they face fundamental limits given that most design

Learning for Clinical Management: From the Lab to the Hospital","normalizedText":"population aging, increasing social demands, and rising costs of treatments are stressing healthcare systems to the point of risking the sustainability of universal and accessible healthcare. a hope in this dismal panorama is that there are large inefficiencies, and so opportunities for getting more from the same resources. to name a few, avoidable hospitalizations, unnecessary medication and tests, and lack of coordination among healthcare agents are estimated to cost several hundred billion euros per year in the eu. technology can be useful for locating and reducing these inefficiencies, and within technology, the full exploitation of the data that the system collects to record its activity. in this talk, i will review the case for activity data analytics in healthcare, with two main considerations: ) the need to include information about resources and costs in the models, in addition to clinical knowledge and patient outcomes, and ) the need to use mostly data that healthcare organizations already collect and is not locked and distributed in silos. fortunately, data collected for administrative and billing purposes, even though imperfect, partial, and low resolution, can be used to improve efficiency and safety, as well as fairness and equity.i will focus on the work carried out at amalfi analytics, a spin-off of my research group at upc in barcelona. on the one hand, we have addressed predictive management in hospitals, from influx to the emergency room to availability of surgical areas, beds, and staff. anticipating activity, needs, and resource availability lets managers improve critical kpis, e.g. waiting times, but also reduce staff stress, which leads to fewer medical errors and accidents. on the other hand, we have developed a patient cohort analyzer, based mostly on a recent clustering algorithm, that gives experts a fresh view of their patient population and lets them refine protocols and identify high-risk patient groups. this tool has also been used to support territorial planning and resource allocation.these problems have been extensively addressed in the past, but actual penetration of solutions in hospitals is smaller than one could expect. for example, one can find hundreds of papers on predicting influx to emergency rooms or bed demands, but many of them conclude after producing an auc figure, and even fewer describe a working system that can be exported from the hospital where they were developed to others at an affordable cost. i will describe the approach taken at amalfi so that hospitals can have such a solution up and running in a few days of work for their it departments, in what i think is an interesting combination of software engineering and automatic machine learning.","tokens":["population","aging","increasing","social","demands","rising","costs","treatments","stressing","healthcare","systems","point","risking","sustainability","universal","accessible","healthcare","hope","dismal","panorama","there","large","inefficiencies","opportunities","getting","more","same","resources","name","few","avoidable","hospitalizations","unnecessary","medication","tests","lack","coordination","among","healthcare","agents","estimated","cost","several","hundred","billion","euros","per","year","technology","useful","locating","reducing","inefficiencies","within","technology","full","exploitation","system","collects","record","activity","talk","will","review","case","activity","analytics","healthcare","two","main","considerations","need","include","information","about","resources","costs","models","addition","clinical","knowledge","patient","outcomes","need","mostly","healthcare","organizations","already","collect","not","locked","distributed","silos","fortunately","collected","administrative","billing","purposes","even","though","imperfect","partial","low","resolution","improve","efficiency","safety","well","fairness","equity","will","focus","work","carried","out","amalfi","analytics","spin","off","research","group","upc","barcelona","one","hand","addressed","predictive","management","hospitals","influx","emergency","room","availability","surgical","areas","beds","staff","anticipating","activity","needs","resource","availability","lets","managers","improve","critical","kpis","waiting","times","but","also","reduce","staff","stress","which","leads","fewer","medical","errors","accidents","other","hand","developed","patient","cohort","analyzer","mostly","recent","clustering","algorithm","gives","experts","fresh","view","patient","population","lets","them","refine","protocols","identify","high","risk","patient","groups","tool","also","been","support","territorial","planning","resource","allocation","problems","been","extensively","addressed","past","but","actual","penetration","solutions","hospitals","smaller","than","one","expect","example","one","hundreds","papers","predicting","influx","emergency","rooms","bed","demands","but","many","them","conclude","after","producing","auc","figure","even","fewer","describe","working","system","exported","hospital","where","they","developed","others","affordable","cost","will","describe","taken","amalfi","hospitals","such","solution","running","few","days","work","departments","what","think","interesting","combination","software","engineering","automatic","machine","learning"]},{"id":"10.1145/3691620.3695532","title":"Constructing

interpret their decision-making processes. surrogate models are constructed to approximate the behavior of a target model and are an essential tool for analyzing black-box models. the construction of a surrogate model typically includes querying the target model with carefully selected data points and using the responses from the target model to infer information about its structure and parameters.in this paper, we propose an approach to surrogate model construction using combinatorial testing and active learning, aiming to efficiently capture the essential interactions between features that drive the target model's predictions. our approach first leverages t-way testing to generate data points that capture all the t-way feature interactions. we then use an iterative process to isolate the essential feature interactions, i.e., those that can determine a model prediction. in the iterative process, we remove nonessential feature interactions, generate additional data points to contain the remaining interactions, and employ active learning techniques to select a subset of the data points to update the surrogate model. this process is continued until we construct a surrogate model that closely mirrors the target model's behavior. we evaluate our approach on public datasets and ml models and compare the results with the state-of-the-art (sota) approaches. our experimental results show that our approach can perform in most cases better than the sota approaches in terms of accuracy and

A Framework to Enable Machine Learning over Billion-node Graphs","normalizedText":"graph neural networks (gnns) have emerged as powerful tools for supervised machine learning over graph-structured data, while sampling-based node representation learning is widely utilized in unsupervised learning. however, scalability remains a major challenge in both supervised and unsupervised learning for large graphs (e.g., those with over billion nodes). the scalability bottleneck largely stems from the mini-batch sampling phase in gnns and the random walk sampling phase in unsupervised methods. these processes often require storing features or embeddings in memory. in the context of distributed training, they require frequent, inefficient random access to data stored across different workers. such repeated inter-worker communication for each mini-batch leads to high communication overhead and computational inefficiency.we propose graphscale, a unified framework for both supervised and unsupervised learning to store and process large graph data distributedly. the key insight in our design is the separation of workers who store data and those who perform the training. this separation allows us to decouple computing and storage in graph training, thus effectively building a pipeline where data fetching and data computation can overlap asynchronously. our experiments show that graphscale outperforms state-of-the-art methods for distributed training of both gnns and node embeddings. we evaluate graphscale both on public and proprietary graph datasets and observe a

aims to accurately predict the learning outcomes in mechanical engineering courses by analyzing students' multi-dimensional data. initially, classical principal component analysis (pca) is employed for data preprocessing purposes. this enables the extraction of key features, reduction of data dimensions, and identification of the core factors influencing academic performance. subsequently, the preprocessed features are fed into a deep learning model based on a long short-term memory network (lstm) architecture. lstm is designed to process time series data, thereby enabling the capture of dynamic changes in students' learning behaviors, including performance trends over time and the time-dependence of learning activities. furthermore, the model incorporates an attention mechanism to dynamically assign weights to different features, thereby facilitating more accurate identification of the factors with the greatest impact on learning outcomes. the experimental results demonstrate

computing infrastructures in the edge-cloud continuum. in this context, fpga-based computing nodes can take advantage of their improved flexibility, performance, and energy efficiency provided that they use proper resource management strategies. in this regard, many state-of-the-art systems rely on proactive power management techniques and task scheduling decisions, which in turn require deep knowledge about the applications to be accelerated and the actual response of the target reconfigurable fabrics when executing them. while acquiring this knowledge at design time was more or less feasible in the past, with applications mostly being static task graphs that did not change at run time, the highly dynamic nature of current workloads in the edge-cloud continuum, where tasks can be deployed on any node and at any time, has removed this possibility. as a result, being able to derive such information at run time to make informed decisions has become a must. this article presents an infrastructure to build incremental ml models that can be used to obtain run-time power consumption and performance estimations in fpga-based reconfigurable multi-accelerator systems operating under dynamic workloads. the proposed infrastructure features a novel stop-and-restart resource-aware mechanism to monitor and control the model training and evaluation stages during normal system operation, enabling low-overhead updates in the models to account for either unexpected acceleration requests (i.e., tasks not considered previously by the models) or model drift (e.g., fabric

Associations Of Chronic Health Outcomes with SDoH Indices Using Machine Learning","normalizedText":"chronic health outcomes require ongoing medical attention and have a significant impact on a person's quality of life. it is widely accepted that social determinants of health (sdoh) shape the onset and management of chronic health outcomes. among the many composite indices that assess sdoh, there is no consensus on which index best explains these associations between health outcomes and social determinants. furthermore, chronic outcomes may be modulated by place or geography both through cultural, social, and political forces and spatial correlations. the novelty of this paper lies in building a machine learning (ml) methodology to compare the strengths of sdoh indices in explaining the associations between chronic health outcomes and social determinants while adjusting for geography. the methodology is illustrated by studying the relative strengths of the social vulnerability index (svi) and social deprivation index (sdi) in explaining age-adjusted prevalence rates of chronic health outcomes obtained from the cdc places project. results suggest that the svi is more strongly associated with all chronic health outcomes, however, the increase in the strength of svi over sdi varies across the health outcomes. for each outcome, importance scores of all svi measures are then normalized according to its four sub themes, while introducing geography/place as the fifth sub theme. comparing the relative importance of these five sub themes leads to a grouping of the outcomes into three clusters depending on whether geography/place, racial minority status, or socio-economic measures shows the greatest impact. the emergence of geography as a dominant sub theme alongside conventional social determinants underscores the value of our approach in providing the capability to consider the modulating effect of geography on understanding the relationships between social determinants and

than the other part (called unprivileged, e.g., female). in alleviating the unfairness, developers have obtained widely-held beliefs about the trade-off between performance and fairness for ml software. surprisingly, recent research on feature engineering suggests that enlarging the feature set is the perfect way to kill two birds with one stone, i.e., achieving both higher performance and fairness. however, the experiments used in the prior study did not remove the effect of protected features, which have been suggested to be excluded in both industrial applications and academic

the protected features and observe that there is still a trade-off between performance and fairness with enlarging the features, i.e., more features are not perfect, which would lead to higher performance and lower fairness. due to more features causing more collection and preprocessing budgets, we aim to search for an effective alternative. inspired by the \"less is more\" principle, we propose a novel feature ranking method, hybrid-importance and early-validation based feature ranking (hefr), to find an efficient subset to replace the full feature set with comparable performance and

vs. rule-set discovery but relied on distinct single-objective or weighted multi-objective fitness functions. this study introduces a newly developed heuristic evolutionary rule optimization system (heros) that combines previous lcs innovations aimed at tackling noisy, larger-scale, classification tasks, while adopting separation of rule vs. rule-set evolution. uniquely, heros employs a custom

Thinking Using Qualitative Data Analysis and Machine Learning","normalizedText":"design thinking is a human-centered approach that allows continuous feedback by the user through empathizing, defining, testing, ideating and prototyping. it mainly focuses on user needs, aspirations, wishes, concerns and frustrations in attempting to solve their problems. the persona creation approach follows the process of collecting data from multiple sources including social media platforms or the traditional methods including interviews of different users to cover the different types of behaviors, interactions and goals, questionnaires, or surveys. condensing gathered data using qualitative data analysis renders assessable domain models that can be shared among and modified by stakeholders, so as to agree on user needs and issues. after agreeing on useful needs and user issues, they are used to generate personas that represent the different types of users of a specific software product. when both approaches design thinking and persona creation are incorporated during agile software development, this would lead to the creation of a successful software product. successful software products are ones that cover all the needs as mentioned by the product user, also known as user perspectives.a user perspective refers to the perception of a given user and how they would use the final product. those are\\\\&nbsp;the people who would interact with the software product created and, therefore, the people for whom\\\\&nbsp;the software is designed. for this reason, if an application, a website or a functionality that does not meet the final user's needs, this would ultimately result in a failure for the business. inducing pain points/insights (what is needed by users) should not left totally to the skills of the analyst with little guidance. a systematic and more guidance is needed in this situation. agile software development lack a coherent and explicit technique or open architecture [ ] that can accommodate changes mandated by experiments on the ground. in addition, there has to be a method for objectively evaluating resultant prototypes/releases/deliverables at the end of each sprint in a way that can effectively guide path adjustments.therefore, in this research, we make use of design thinking with software products. through creating a framework that includes design thinking as an elicitation technique. we propose a framework composed of two phases: the first phase is the use of a robust qualitative data analysis method, to achieve models that are rich, and at the same time concise and traceable to their origins. we propose the use of the grounded theory method in the analysis and integration of the qualitative data that can characterize user needs, pain points and system requirements, in addition to second layer requirements that are often hard to spot. second layer requirements are those requirements that are not immediately visible or perceivable by the end-user of a system, or those working with or observing him or her, such as systems and requirements analysts. the source of data for generating grounded theoretical formulations include interviews (of whatever type), observations, online chatter, and documents relating to the immediate and wider contexts of the need phenomenon under study.the second part of our proposed framework is applying machine learning on the data resulting from the first phase so that we are able to automate the persona creation using machine learning. automatic persona creation via machine learning is used to represent potential users, as an attempt to enhance the requirements of software products since they will necessarily include user perspectives.","tokens":["design","thinking","human","centered","allows","continuous","feedback","user","through","empathizing","defining","testing","ideating","prototyping","mainly","focuses","user","needs","aspirations","wishes","concerns","frustrations","attempting","solve","problems","persona","creation","follows","process","collecting","multiple","sources","including","social","media","platforms","traditional","including","interviews","different","users","cover","different","types","behaviors","interactions","goals","questionnaires","surveys","condensing","gathered","qualitative","analysis","renders","assessable","domain","models","shared","among","modified","stakeholders","agree","user","needs","issues","after","agreeing","useful","needs","user","issues","they","generate","personas","represent","different","types","users","specific","software","product","when","both","design","thinking","persona","creation","incorporated","during","agile","software","development","would","lead","creation","successful","software","product","successful","software","products","ones","cover","all","needs","mentioned","product","user","also","known","user","perspectives","user","perspective","refers","perception","given","user","how","they","would","final","product","nbsp","people","who","would","interact","software","product","created","therefore","people","whom","nbsp","software","designed","reason","application","website","functionality","does","not","meet","final","user","needs","would","ultimately","failure","business","inducing","pain","points","insights","what","needed","users","should","not","left","totally","skills","analyst","little","guidance","systematic","more","guidance","needed","situation","agile","software","development","lack","coherent","explicit","technique","open","architecture","accommodate","changes","mandated","experiments","ground","addition","there","objectively","evaluating","resultant","prototypes","releases","deliverables","end","each","sprint","way","effectively","guide","path","adjustments","therefore","research","make","design","thinking","software","products","through","creating","framework","includes","design","thinking","elicitation","technique","propose","framework","composed","two","phases","first","phase","robust","qualitative","analysis","achieve","models","rich","same","time","concise","traceable","origins","propose","grounded","theory","analysis","integration","qualitative","characterize","user","needs","pain","points","system","requirements","addition","second","layer","requirements","often","hard","spot","second","layer","requirements","requirements","not","immediately","visible","perceivable","end","user","system","working","observing","him","her","such","systems","requirements","analysts","source","generating","grounded","theoretical","formulations","include","interviews","whatever","type","observations","online","chatter","documents","relating","immediate","wider","contexts","need","phenomenon","under","second","part","proposed","framework","applying","machine","learning","resulting","first","phase","able","automate","persona","creation","machine","learning","automatic","persona","creation","machine","learning","represent","potential","users","attempt","enhance","requirements","software","products","since","they","will","necessarily","include","user","perspectives"]},{"id":"10.1145/3703847.3703853","title":"Advancing

Feature Attribution Explanation For Explainable Machine Learning","normalizedText":"the feature attribution-based explanation (fae) methods, which indicate how much each input feature contributes to the model's output for a given data point, are one of the most popular categories of explainable machine learning techniques. although various metrics have been proposed to evaluate the explanation quality, no single metric could capture different aspects of the explanations. different conclusions might be drawn using different metrics. moreover, during the processes of generating explanations, existing fae methods either do not consider any evaluation metric or only consider the faithfulness of the explanation, failing to consider multiple metrics simultaneously. to address this issue, we formulate the problem of creating fae explainable models as a multi-objective learning problem that considers multiple explanation quality metrics simultaneously. we first reveal conflicts between various explanation quality metrics, including faithfulness, sensitivity, and complexity. then, we define the considered multi-objective explanation problem and propose a multi-objective feature attribution explanation (mofae) framework to address this newly defined problem. subsequently, we instantiate the framework by simultaneously considering the explanation's faithfulness, sensitivity, and complexity. experimental results comparing with six state-of-the-art fae methods on eight datasets demonstrate that our method can optimize multiple conflicting metrics simultaneously and can provide explanations with higher faithfulness, lower sensitivity, and lower complexity than the compared methods. moreover, the results have shown that our method has better diversity, i.e., it provides various explanations that achieve different tradeoffs between multiple conflicting explanation quality metrics. therefore, it can provide tailored explanations to different stakeholders based

Machine Learning with a Ring-based Distributed Framework","normalizedText":"in centralized distributed machine learning systems, communication overhead between servers and computing nodes has always been an important issue affecting the training efficiency. although existing research has proposed various measures to reduce communication overhead between nodes in parameter server frameworks, the communication pressure and overhead inherited from centralized architectures are still significant. to address the above issue, this paper proposes a ring-based parameter server framework that is distinct from node division and model training mechanism in the standard p/s framework. the ring-based architecture cancels the global model stored on the server side, and each computing node stores a local copy of the model. during model training, computing nodes can asynchronously train local models based on local or remote training data. after all nodes finish learning, the ensemble learning method can predict test data based on all local models. to avoid the negative impact of remote data reading on model training efficiency, a producer-consumer data reading strategy is proposed. this strategy can reduce data reading overhead in a pipeline manner. to make rational use of the input and output bandwidths of all nodes, a circular data scheduling mechanism is proposed. at any given time, this mechanism ensures each node has at most one input stream and one output stream, thereby dispersing communication pressure. the experimental results show that the proposed distributed

used to train the defenders. they also resist adaptive attacks, where attackers train using the obfuscated signals collected while the defender is active. finally, the approach is general enough to be applicable to different environments. we demonstrate friendlyfoe against two side channel attacks: one based on memory contention and one on system power. the first example uses a hardware defender with ns-level response time that, for the same level of security as a pad-to-constant scheme, has \\\\% and \\\\% lower performance overhead for single- and multi-threaded workloads, respectively. the

designed to complement the system-level black-box testing at nokia, as cost-effectiveness is the main success criterion for further feasibility studies leading to a potential commercial introduction. method: to evaluate the expected cost-effectiveness, we utilize one of the available cost models for software defect prediction formulated by previous studies on the subject. second, we calculate the standard return on investment (roi) and benefit-cost ratio (bcr) financial ratios to demonstrate the profitability of the developed approach based on real-world, business-driven examples. third, we build an ms excel-based tool to automate the evaluation of similar scenarios that other researchers and practitioners can use. results: we considered different periods of operation and varying efficiency of predictions, depending on which of the two proposed scenarios were selected (lightweight or advanced). performed roi and bcr calculations have shown that the implemented ml sdp can have a positive monetary impact and be cost-effective in both scenarios. conclusions: the cost of adopting new technology is rarely analyzed and discussed in the existing scientific literature, while it is

Dataset Bias and Scaling Techniques in Multi-Source Gait Biomechanics: An Explainable Machine Learning Approach","normalizedText":"machine learning has become increasingly important in biomechanics. it allows to unveil hidden patterns from large and complex data, which leads to a more comprehensive understanding of biomechanical processes and deeper insights into human movement. however, machine learning models are often trained on a single dataset with a limited number of participants, which negatively affects their robustness and generalizability. combining data from multiple existing sources provides an opportunity to overcome these limitations without spending more time on recruiting participants and recording new data. it is furthermore an opportunity for researchers who lack the financial requirements or laboratory equipment to conduct expensive motion capture studies themselves. at the same time, subtle interlaboratory differences can be problematic in an analysis due to the bias that they introduce. in our study, we investigated differences in motion capture datasets in the context of machine learning, for which we combined overground walking trials from four existing studies. specifically, our goal was to examine whether a machine learning model was able to predict the original data source based on marker and grf trajectories of single strides and how different scaling methods and pooling procedures affected the outcome. layer-wise relevance propagation was applied to understand which factors were influential to distinguish the original data sources. we found that the model could predict the original data source with a very high accuracy (up to (gt) \\\\%), which decreased by about percentage points when we scaled every dataset individually prior to pooling. however, none of the proposed scaling methods could fully remove the dataset bias. layer-wise relevance propagation revealed that there was not only one single factor that differed between all datasets. instead, every dataset had its unique characteristics that were picked up by the model. these variables differed between the scaling and pooling approaches but were mostly consistent between trials belonging to the same dataset. our results show that motion capture data is sensitive even to small deviations in marker placement and experimental setup and that small inter-group differences should not be overinterpreted during data analysis, especially when the data was collected in different labs. furthermore, we recommend scaling datasets individually

methodologies predominantly emphasize quantitative metrics like throughput and accuracy, exemplified by mlperf and hpc-ai . such quantitative focus neglects key qualitative factors-portability, robustness, deployment complexity, and usefulness-essential for practical parallel ml. this paper argues for a paradigm shift in benchmarking, advocating for a holistic evaluation framework that inherently integrates qualitative assessments alongside traditional quantitative measures. to this end, we introduce nnopp (neural network on-top-of parallel processing), a structured evaluation

real-world ml solution viability, sustainability, and impact. beyond performance numbers, these metrics promote sustainable solutions: computationally efficient, practically deployable, broadly applicable, and robust across diverse contexts. through illustrative case studies across key dl model families, we demonstrate the application of nnopp and its capacity to provide nuanced insights beyond conventional benchmark rankings. future directions for parallel ml benchmarking emphasize integrated metrics, dynamic workloads, domain-specific relevance, and collaborative community

which uses a general multitask learning framework to handle statistical challenges in the federated learning setting. the problem of calculating optimal poisoning attacks on federated multitask

as attack on federated learning (at( )fl), to efficiently derive the implicit gradients for poisoned data, and further attain optimal attack strategies in the federated machine learning. this is an earlier work, to our knowledge, that explores attacking federated machine learning via data poisoning. finally, experiments on several real-world data sets demonstrate that when the attackers directly poison the target nodes or indirectly poison the related nodes via using the communication protocol, the federated multitask learning model is sensitive to both poisoning

learning tasks where data is provided can be considerably different than commonly studied computational tasks. in this work, we show that some problems that are classically hard to compute can be easily predicted by classical machines learning from data. using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks. the bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models. these constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine

data repositories (e.g. electronic medical record databases) and advances in computing power, traditional statistical approaches are being augmented or replaced with machine learning (ml) approaches to classify and predict health outcomes. ml describes the automated process of identifying (''learning'') patterns in data to perform tasks. developing an ml model includes selecting between many ml models (e.g. decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks); model specifications such as hyperparameter tuning; and evaluation of model performance. this process is conducted repeatedly to find the model and corresponding specifications that optimize some measure of model performance. ml models can make more accurate classifications and predictions than their statistical counterparts and confer greater flexibility when modelling unstructured data or interactions between covariates; however, many ml models require larger sample sizes to achieve good classification or predictive performance and have been criticized as ``black box'' for their poor transparency and interpretability. ml holds potential in family medicine for risk profiling of patients' disease risk and clinical decision support to present additional information at times of uncertainty or high demand. in the future, ml approaches are positioned to become commonplace in family medicine. as such, it is important to understand the objectives that can be addressed using ml approaches and the associated techniques and limitations. this article provides a brief introduction into the use of ml approaches

algorithms that learn from data to reach an optimal solution for a problem. these algorithms provide exciting potential for the accurate, accessible, and cost-effective early identification, prevention, and treatment of eating disorders, but this potential is just beginning to be explored. research to date has mainly used machine learning to predict women's eating disorder status with relatively high levels of accuracy from responses to validated surveys, social media posts, or neuroimaging data. these studies show potential for the use of machine learning in the field, but we are far from using these methods in practice. useful avenues for future research include the use of machine learning to personalise prevention and treatment options, provide ecological momentary interventions via smartphones, and to aid clinicians with their treatment fidelity and effectiveness. more research is needed with large samples of diverse participants to ensure that machine learning models are accurate, unbiased, and generalisable to all people with eating disorders. there are limitations and ethical considerations with using these methods in practice. if accurate and generalisable machine learning models can be created in the field of eating disorders, it could improve the way we identify, prevent, and treat these debilitating disorders. advances in machine learning and digital data provide vast potential for mental health predictions. however, research using machine learning in the field of eating disorders is just beginning to emerge. this paper provides a narrative review of existing research and explores potential benefits, limitations, and ethical considerations of using machine learning to aid in the detection, prevention, and treatment of eating disorders. current research primarily uses machine learning to predict eating disorder status from females' responses to validated surveys, social media posts, or neuroimaging data often with relatively high levels of accuracy. this early work provides evidence for the potential of machine learning to improve current eating disorder screening methods. however, the ability of these algorithms to generalise to other samples or be used on a mass scale is only beginning to be explored. one key benefit of machine learning over traditional statistical methods is the ability of machine learning to simultaneously examine large numbers ( s to s) of multimodal predictors and their complex non-linear interactions, but few studies have explored this potential in the field of eating disorders. machine learning is also being used to develop chatbots to provide psychoeducation and coping skills training around body image and eating disorders, with implications for early intervention. the use of machine learning to personalise treatment options, provide ecological momentary interventions, and aid the work of clinicians is also discussed. machine learning provides vast potential for the accurate, rapid, and cost-effective detection, prevention, and treatment of eating disorders. more research is needed with large samples of diverse participants to ensure that machine learning models are accurate, unbiased, and generalisable to all people with eating disorders. there are important limitations and ethical considerations with utilising machine learning

society owing to their ability to recognize and predict patterns. however, the decision-making logic of some widely used machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, is characterized by

calls for research that studies empirically and theoretically how machine learning experts and users seek to attain machine learning explainability. focusing on automated trading, we take steps in this direction by analyzing a trading firm's quest for explaining its deep neural network system's actionable predictions. we demonstrate that this explainability effort involves a particular form of

machine learning (automl) to help healthcare professionals better utilize machine learning models ``off-the-shelf'' with limited data science expertise. we also identify the potential opportunities and barriers to using automl in healthcare, as well as existing applications of automl in healthcare. methods: published papers, accompanied with code, describing work in the field of automl from both a computer science perspective or a biomedical informatics perspective were reviewed. we also provide a short summary of a series of automl challenges hosted by chalearn. results: a review of papers in the field of automl revealed that these automated techniques can match or improve upon expert human performance in certain machine learning tasks, often in a shorter amount of time. the main limitation of automl at this point is the ability to get these systems to work efficiently on a large scale, i.e. beyond small- and medium-size retrospective datasets. discussion: the utilization of machine learning techniques has the demonstrated potential to improve health outcomes, cut healthcare costs, and advance clinical research. however, most hospitals are not currently deploying machine learning solutions. one reason for this is that health care professionals often lack the machine learning expertise that is necessary to build a successful model, deploy it in production, and integrate it with the clinical workflow. in order to make machine learning techniques easier to apply and to reduce the demand for human experts, automated machine learning (automl) has emerged as a growing field that seeks to automatically select, compose, and parametrize machine learning models, so as to achieve optimal performance on a given task and/or dataset. conclusion: while there have

led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. in particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. we aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (pdr) framework for discussing interpretations. the pdr framework provides overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. to demonstrate how practitioners can use the pdr framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. these examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. we hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation

both have considerable impact on the feasibility of the project. the next phases are comprised of data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. special focus is applied to the last phase, as a model running in changing real-time environments requires close monitoring and maintenance to reduce the risk of performance degradation over time. with each task of the process, this work proposes quality assurance methodology that is suitable to address challenges in machine learning development that are identified in the form of risks. the methodology is drawn from practical experience and

of Four Machine Learning Methods for Spatial Data Handling: a Review","normalizedText":"most machine learning tasks can be categorized into classification or regression problems. regression and classification models are normally used to extract useful geographic information from observed or measured spatial data, such as land cover classification, spatial interpolation, and quantitative parameter retrieval. this paper reviews the progress of four advanced machine learning methods for spatial data handling, namely, support vector machine (svm)-based kernel learning, semi-supervised and active learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning. these four machine learning modes are representative because they improve learning performances from different views, for example, feature space transform and decision function (svm), optimized uses of samples (semi-supervised and active learning), and enhanced learning models and capabilities (ensemble learning and deep learning). for spatial data handling via machine learning that can be improved by the four machine learning models, three key elements are learning algorithms, training samples, and input features. to apply machine learning methods to spatial data handling successfully, a four-level strategy is suggested: experimenting and evaluating the applicability, extending the algorithms by embedding spatial properties, optimizing the parameters for better performance, and enhancing the algorithm by multiple means. firstly, the advances of svm are reviewed to demonstrate the merits of novel machine learning methods for spatial data, running the line from direct use and comparison with traditional classifiers, and then targeted improvements to address multiple class problems, to optimize parameters of svm, and to use spatial and spectral features. to overcome the limits of small-size training samples, semi-supervised learning and active learning methods are then utilized to deal with insufficient labeled samples, showing the potential of learning from small-size training samples. furthermore, considering the poor generalization capacity and instability of machine learning algorithms, ensemble learning is introduced to integrate the advantages of multiple learners and to enhance the generalization capacity. the typical research lines, including the combination of multiple classifiers, advanced ensemble classifiers, and spatial interpolation, are presented. finally, deep learning, one of the most popular branches of machine learning, is reviewed with specific examples for scene classification and urban structural type recognition from high-resolution remote sensing images. by this review, it can be concluded that machine learning methods are very effective for spatial data

we consider an environment in which consumers query for data to enhance the accuracy of their models and data providers who possess data make them available for training purposes. we first formalize

estimation and allocation (ea), we utilize queries to estimate the utilities of various predicates while learning about the distribution of the provider's data; then we proceed to the allocation stage in which we utilize those learned utility estimates to inform our data acquisition decisions. the second algorithmic proposal, named sequential predicate selection (sps), utilizes a sampling strategy to explore the distribution of the provider's data, adaptively investing more resources to parts of the data space that are statistically more promising to improve overall model accuracy. we present a

of artificial intelligence. deep learning often depends on backwards propagation in weighted neural networks, so is non-deterministic-the system adapts and changes through practical experience or training. this adaptive behaviour predicates the need for explainability and accountability in such systems. accountability is the reverse of explainability. explainability flows through the system from inputs to output (decision) whereas accountability flows backwards, from a decision to the person taking responsibility for it. both explainability and accountability should be incorporated in machine learning system design from the outset to meet social, ethical and legislative requirements. for students to be able to understand the nature of the systems that may be supporting their own learning as well as to act as responsible citizens in contemplating the ethical issues that machine learning raises, they need to understand key aspects of machine learning systems and have opportunities to adapt and create such systems. therefore, some changes are needed to school curricula. the article concludes with recommendations about machine learning for teachers, students, policymakers, developers and researchers.","tokens":["machine","learning","systems","infiltrating","lives","beginning","become","important","education","systems","article","developed","synthesis","analysis","previous","research","examines","implications","recent","developments","machine","learning","human","learners","learning","article","first","compare","deep","learning","computers","humans","examine","similarities","differences","deep","learning","identified","sub","set","machine","learning","which","itself","component","artificial","intelligence","deep","learning","often","depends","backwards","propagation","weighted","neural","networks","non","deterministic","system","adapts","changes","through","practical","experience","training","adaptive","behaviour","predicates","need","explainability","accountability","such","systems","accountability","reverse","explainability","explainability","flows","through","system","inputs","output","decision","whereas","accountability","flows","backwards","decision","person","taking","responsibility","both","explainability","accountability","should","incorporated","machine","learning","system","design","outset","meet","social","ethical","legislative","requirements","students","able","understand","nature","systems","supporting","own","learning","well","act","responsible","citizens","contemplating","ethical","issues","machine","learning","raises","they","need","understand","key","aspects","machine","learning","systems","opportunities","adapt","create","such","systems","therefore","some","changes","needed","school","curricula","article","concludes","recommendations","about","machine","learning","teachers","students","policymakers","developers","researchers"]},{"id":"10.1016/j.commatsci.2020.109544","title":"The

bias vector, ( ) an activation map and ( ) a loss function. we argue that the loss function can be imposed either on the boundary (i.e. input and/or output neurons) or in the bulk (i.e. hidden neurons) for both supervised and unsupervised systems. we apply the principle of maximum entropy to derive a canonical ensemble of the state vectors subject to a constraint imposed on the bulk loss function by a lagrange multiplier (or an inverse temperature parameter). we show that in an equilibrium the canonical partition function must be a product of two factors: a function of the temperature, and a function of the bias vector and weight matrix. consequently, the total shannon entropy consists of two terms which represent, respectively, a thermodynamic entropy and a complexity of the neural network. we derive the first and second laws of learning: during learning the total entropy must decrease until the system reaches an equilibrium (i.e. the second law), and the increment in the loss function must be proportional to the increment in the thermodynamic entropy plus the increment in the complexity (i.e. the first law). we calculate the entropy destruction to show that the efficiency of learning is given by the laplacian of the total free energy, which is to be maximized in an optimal neural architecture, and explain why the optimization condition is better satisfied in a deep network with a large number of hidden layers. the key properties of the model are verified numerically by training a supervised feedforward neural network using the stochastic gradient descent

transplant has not been done to date. the main aim of our study was to perform an in-depth systematic analysis of different machine learning methods used to predict graft outcomes among kidney transplant patients, and assess their usefulness as an aid to decision-making. methods: a systemic review of machine learning methods used to predict graft outcomes among kidney transplant patients

machine learning from a human-centered perspective includes explicitly recognizing human work, as well as reframing machine learning workflows based on situated human working practices, and exploring the co-adaptation of humans and intelligent systems. a human-centered understanding of machine learning in human contexts can lead not only to more usable machine learning tools, but to new ways of understanding what machine learning is good for and how to make it more useful. this special issue brings together nine articles that present different ways to frame machine learning in a human

we assess the performance capability of the machine learning techniques in existing research for software fault prediction. we also compare the performance of the machine learning techniques with the statistical techniques and other machine learning techniques. further the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning techniques are summarized. results: in this paper we have identified primary

which reduces some systematic privacy risks and costs brought by traditional centralized machine learning methods. the original data of the client is stored locally and cannot be exchanged or

therefore become an important metric because it directly affects the energy consumed during the operation of a machine tool. attempts to predict machining power using machine learning have relied on the training datasets processed from actual machining data to derive the numerical relationship between process parameters and machining power. however, real fields hardly provide training datasets because of the difficulties in data collection; consequently, traditional learning approaches are ineffective in such data-scarce or -absent environment. this paper proposes a transfer learning

machining context where machining power data are absent. the proposed approach performs domain adaptation by adding workpiece material properties to the original feature space for accommodating different machining power patterns dependent on the types of workpiece materials. a case study demonstrates that the training datasets obtained from the fabrication of steel and aluminum materials can be successfully used to create the power-predictive models that anticipate machining power for titanium

it is difficult to obtain massive labeled data. moreover, even though labeled data can be obtained from some machines, the intelligent fault diagnosis method trained with such labeled data possibly fails in classifying unlabeled data acquired from the other machines due to data distribution discrepancy. these problems limit the successful applications of intelligent fault diagnosis of machines with unlabeled data. as a potential tool, transfer learning adapts a model trained in a source domain to its application in a target domain. based on the transfer learning, we propose a new intelligent method named deep convolutional transfer learning network (dctln). a dctln consists of two modules: condition recognition and domain adaptation. the condition recognition module is constructed by a one-dimensional ( -d) convolutional neural network (cnn) to automatically learn features and recognize health conditions of machines. the domain adaptation module facilitates the -d

Zeroth-Order Adaptive Learning Rate Method to Reduce Cost of Hyperparameter Tuning for Deep Learning","normalizedText":"due to powerful data representation ability, deep learning has dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in many practical applications. however, the utility highly depends on fine-tuning of hyper-parameters, including learning rate, batch size, and network initialization. although many first-order adaptive methods (e.g., adam, adagrad) have been proposed to adjust learning rate based on gradients, they are susceptible to the initial learning rate and network architecture. therefore, the main challenge of using deep learning in practice is how to reduce the cost of tuning hyper-parameters. to address this, we propose a heuristic zeroth-order learning rate method, adacomp, which adaptively adjusts the learning rate based only on values of the loss function. the main idea is that adacomp penalizes large learning rates to ensure the convergence and compensates small learning rates to accelerate the training process. therefore, adacomp is robust to the initial learning rate. extensive experiments, including comparison to six typically adaptive methods (momentum, adagrad, rmsprop, adadelta, adam, and adamax) on several benchmark datasets for image classification tasks (mnist, kmnist, fashion-mnist, cifar- , and cifar- ), were conducted.

from clinical epidemiological research in diabetes published from jan to june . recent findings machine learning approaches using tree-based learners-which produce decision trees to help guide clinical interventions-frequently have higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional regression models for risk prediction. machine learning approaches using neural networking and ``deep learning'' can be applied to medical image data, particularly for the identification and staging of diabetic retinopathy and skin ulcers. among the machine learning approaches reviewed, researchers identified new strategies to develop standard datasets for rigorous comparisons across older and newer approaches, methods to illustrate how a machine learner was treating underlying data, and approaches to improve the transparency of the machine learning process. machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications. achieving this potential would be facilitated by use of universal open-source datasets for fair comparisons. more work remains in the application of strategies to communicate how the

classification results, the evaluation metric afg, arithmetic mean of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auc), f-measure and g-mean are used to evaluate the classification performance of machine learning models. finally, based on afg and coefficient of variation (cv), the performance stability evaluation method of machine learning models is proposed. experiments of

modeling for chatter avoidance in self-aware machining: an application of physics-guided machine learning","normalizedText":"physics-guided machine learning (pgml) offers a new approach to stability modeling during machining that leverages experimental data generated during the machining process while incorporating decades of theoretical process modeling efforts. this approach addresses specific limitations of machine learning models and physics-based models individually. data-driven machine learning models are typically black box models that do not provide deep insight into the underlying physics and do not reflect physical constraints for the modeled system, sometimes yielding solutions that violate physical laws or operational constraints. in addition, acquiring the large amounts of manufacturing data needed for machine learning modeling can be costly. on the other hand, many physical processes are not completely understood by domain experts and have a high degree of uncertainty. physics-based models must make simplifying assumptions that can compromise prediction accuracy. this research explores whether data generated by an uncertain physics-based milling stability model that is used to train a physics-guided machine learning stability model, and then updated with measured data, domain knowledge, and theory-based knowledge provides a useful approximation to the unknown true stability model for a specific set of factory operating conditions. four novel strategies for updating the machine learning model with experimental data are explored. these updating strategies differ in their assumptions about and implementation of the type of physics-based knowledge included in the pgml model. using a simulation experiment, these strategies achieve useful approximations of the underlying true stability model while reducing the number of experimental measurements required for model update.","tokens":["physics","guided","machine","learning","pgml","offers","new","stability","modeling","during","machining","leverages","experimental","generated","during","machining","process","while","incorporating","decades","theoretical","process","modeling","efforts","addresses","specific","limitations","machine","learning","models","physics","models","individually","driven","machine","learning","models","typically","black","box","models","not","provide","deep","insight","underlying","physics","not","reflect","physical","constraints","modeled","system","sometimes","yielding","solutions","violate","physical","laws","operational","constraints","addition","acquiring","large","amounts","manufacturing","needed","machine","learning","modeling","costly","other","hand","many","physical","processes","not","completely","understood","domain","experts","high","degree","uncertainty","physics","models","must","make","simplifying","assumptions","compromise","prediction","accuracy","research","explores","whether","generated","uncertain","physics","milling","stability","model","train","physics","guided","machine","learning","stability","model","then","updated","measured","domain","knowledge","theory","knowledge","provides","useful","approximation","unknown","true","stability","model","specific","set","factory","operating","conditions","four","novel","strategies","updating","machine","learning","model","experimental","explored","updating","strategies","differ","assumptions","about","implementation","type","physics","knowledge","included","pgml","model","simulation","experiment","strategies","achieve","useful","approximations","underlying","true","stability","model","while","reducing","number","experimental","measurements","required","model","update"]},{"id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153559","title":"Machine

available, with the use of high-performance computing and high-throughput experimentation, machine learning has proven potential to accelerate scientific research and technology development. though the uptake of data-driven approaches for materials science is at an exciting, early stage, to realize the true potential of machine learning models for successful scientific discovery, they must have qualities beyond purely predictive power. the predictions and inner workings of models should provide a certain degree of explainability by human experts, permitting the identification of potential model issues or limitations, building trust in model predictions, and unveiling unexpected correlations that may lead to scientific insights. in this work, we summarize applications of interpretability and explainability techniques for materials science and chemistry and discuss how these techniques can improve the outcome of scientific studies. we start by defining the fundamental concepts of interpretability and explainability in machine learning and making them less abstract by providing examples in the field. we show how interpretability in scientific machine learning has additional constraints compared to general applications. building upon formal definitions in machine learning, we formulate the basic trade-offs among the explainability, completeness, and scientific validity of model explanations in scientific problems. in the context of these trade-offs, we discuss how interpretable models can be constructed, what insights they provide, and what drawbacks they have. we present numerous examples of the application of interpretable machine learning in a variety of experimental and simulation studies, encompassing first-principles calculations, physicochemical characterization, materials development, and integration into complex systems. we discuss the varied impacts and uses of interpretabiltiy in these cases according to the nature and constraints of the scientific study of interest. we discuss various challenges for interpretable machine learning in materials science and, more broadly, in scientific settings. in particular, we emphasize the risks of inferring causation or reaching generalization by purely interpreting machine learning models and the need for uncertainty estimates for model explanations. finally, we showcase a number of exciting developments in other fields that could benefit interpretability in material science problems. adding interpretability to a machine learning model often requires no more technical know-how than

Progress and Trend of the Machine Learning based on Fusion","normalizedText":"machine learning is widely used in the data processing including data classification, data regression, data mining and so on, and based on a single type of machine learning technology, it is often difficult to meet the requirements of data processing; in recent years, the machine learning based on fusion has become an important approach to improve data processing effect, and at the same time, corresponding summary study is relatively limited. in this study, we summarize and compare different types of fusion machine learning such as ensemble learning, federated learning and transfer learning from the perspectives of classification, principle and characteristics, and try to explore the research development trend, in order to provide effective reference for subsequent related research and application; furthermore, as an application of fusion machine learning,we also conduct a study on the modeling optimization
