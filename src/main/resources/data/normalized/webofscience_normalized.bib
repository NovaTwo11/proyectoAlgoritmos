However, its impact on consumer behavior has remained empirically untested. In response to social media platforms mandating the disclosure of GenAI content, we investigate how followers perceive brands that use GenAI for content creation. Drawing from literature on algorithm aversion and brand authenticity, the results of three experimental studies indicate that brands' GenAI adoption induces negative attitudinal and behavioral follower reactions. These effects are mediated by followers' perceptions of brand authenticity and can be triggered by GenAI disclosure. Negative reactions are attenuated if GenAI is used to assist humans in content creation rather than to replace them through automation. Our findings underscore the need for nuance in brands' GenAI adoption to unlock economic benefits without compromising on relationships with consumers.} }

The survey for this study was created by a library student team and vetted through focus groups. A total of 2555 students participated in the survey. Results showed that only 7\% of students who responded had not heard of any GAI technologies, whilst over half had used or considered using these for academic purposes. The majority of students (54.1\%) were supportive or somewhat supportive of using tools such as Grammarly, but 70.4\% were unsupportive or somewhat unsupportive towards students using tools such as ChatGPT to write their whole essay. Students who had higher levels of confidence in their academic writing were less likely to use or consider using them for academic purposes, and were also less likely to be supportive of other students using them. Most students (41.1\%) also thought there should be a university wide policy on when these technologies are or are not appropriate to use. The results of this research suggest that students require clear policies on the use of GAI and that these technologies should not be banned from university, but consideration must be made to ensure different groups of students have equal access to the technologies.} }

The present research intended to investigate the characteristics of students' task motivation in the artificial intelligence context, specifically in the ChatGPT context. The researchers interviewed 15 students about their experiences with ChatGPT to collect data. The researchers used inductive and deductive content analysis to investigate students' motivation when learning with ChatGPT. To arrive at the categories and sub-categories of students' motivation, the researchers used the MAXQDA 2022. Five main categories emerged: task enjoyment, reported effort, result assessment, perceived relevance, and interaction. Each category comprised at least two sub-categories, and each sub-category was further organized into codes. The results indicated more positive characteristics of motivation than negative ones. The previous results could be due to the conversational or social aspect of the chatbot, enabling relationships with humans and enabling the maintenance of good quality conversations with them. We conclude that a generative AI could be utilized in educational settings to promote students' motivation to learn and thus raise their learning achievement.} }

As the first surgical applications of generative artificial intelligence are applied, this perspective paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current applications and future perspectives for the application of generative artificial intelligence in surgery, from preoperative planning to training. Generative artificial intelligence can be used before surgery for planning and decision support by extracting patient information and providing patients with information and simulation regarding the procedure. Intraoperatively, generative artificial intelligence can document data that is normally not captured as intraoperative adverse events or provide information to help decision-making. Postoperatively, GAIs can help with patient discharge and follow-up. The ability to provide real-time feedback and store it for later review is an important capability of GAIs. GAI applications are emerging as highly specialized, task-specific tools for tasks such as data extraction, synthesis, presentation, and communication within the realm of surgery. GAIs have the potential to play a pivotal role in facilitating interaction between surgeons and artificial intelligence. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.} }

Digital twins, which are in silico replications of an individual and its environment, have advanced clinical decision-making and prognostication in cardiovascular medicine. The technology enables personalized simulations of clinical scenarios, prediction of disease risk, and strategies for clinical trial augmentation. Current applications of cardiovascular digital twins have integrated multi-modal data into mechanistic and statistical models to build physiologically accurate cardiac replicas to enhance disease phenotyping, enrich diagnostic workflows, and optimize procedural planning. Digital twin technology is rapidly evolving in the setting of newly available data modalities and advances in generative artificial intelligence, enabling dynamic and comprehensive simulations unique to an individual. These twins fuse physiologic, environmental, and healthcare data into machine learning and generative models to build real-time patient predictions that can model interactions with the clinical environment to accelerate personalized patient care. This review summarizes digital twins in cardiovascular medicine and their potential future applications by incorporating new personalized data modalities. It examines the technical advances in deep learning and generative artificial intelligence that broaden the scope and predictive power of digital twins. Finally, it highlights the individual and societal challenges as well as ethical considerations that are essential to realizing the future vision of incorporating cardiology digital twins into personalized cardiovascular care.} }

There is an urgent need to develop students' evaluative judgement - the capability to judge the quality of work of self and others - in recognition of this new reality. In this conceptual paper, we describe the intersection between evaluative judgement and generative AI with a view to articulating how assessment practices can help students learn to work productively with generative AI. We propose three foci: (1) developing evaluative judgement of generative AI outputs; (2) developing evaluative judgement of generative AI processes; and (3) generative AI assessment of student evaluative judgements. We argue for developing students' capabilities to identify and calibrate quality of work - uniquely human capabilities at a time of technological acceleration - through existing formative assessment strategies. These approaches circumvent and interrupt students' uncritical usage of generative AI. The relationship between evaluative judgement and generative AI is more than just the application of human judgement to machine outputs. We have a collective responsibility, as educators and learners, to ensure that humans do not relinquish their roles as arbiters of quality.} }

In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students' individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K-12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students' attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.} }

We find that freelancers in highly affected occupations suffer from the introduction of generative AI, experiencing reductions in both employment and earnings. We find similar effects studying the release of other image-based generative AI models. Exploring the heterogeneity by freelancers' employment history, we do not find evidence that high-quality service, measured by their past performance and employment, moderates the adverse effects on employment.

DTs increase the efficiency of drug discovery and development by digitalizing processes associated with high economic, ethical, or social burden. The impact is multifaceted: DT models sharpen disease understanding, support biomarker discovery and accelerate drug development, thus advancing precision medicine. One way to realize DTs is by generative artificial intelligence (AI), a cutting-edge technology that enables the creation of novel, realistic and complex data with desired properties.Areas covered: The authors provide a brief introduction to generative AI and describe how it facilitates the modeling of DTs. In addition, they compare existing implementations of generative AI for DTs in drug discovery and clinical trials. Finally, they discuss technical and regulatory challenges that should be addressed before DTs can transform drug discovery and clinical trials.Expert opinion: The current state of DTs in drug discovery and clinical trials does not exploit the entire power of generative AI yet and is limited to simulation of a small number of characteristics.

The first involves fine-tuning existing molecules or commercially successful drugs through quantitative structure-activity relationships and virtual screening. The second approach involves generating new molecules through de novo drug design or inverse quantitative structure-activity relationship. Both methods aim to get a drug molecule with the best pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. However, bringing a new drug to market is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor, with the average cost being estimated at around \$2.5 billion. One of the biggest challenges is screening the vast number of potential drug candidates to find one that is both safe and effective. The development of artificial intelligence in recent years has been phenomenal, ushering in a revolution in many fields. The field of pharmaceutical sciences has also significantly benefited from multiple applications of artificial intelligence, especially drug discovery projects. Artificial intelligence models are finding use in molecular property prediction, molecule generation, virtual screening, synthesis planning, repurposing, among others. Lately, generative artificial intelligence has gained popularity across domains for its ability to generate entirely new data, such as images, sentences, audios, videos, novel chemical molecules, etc. Generative artificial intelligence has also delivered promising results in drug discovery and development. This review article delves into the fundamentals and framework of various generative artificial intelligence models in the context of drug discovery via de novo drug design approach. Various basic and advanced models have been discussed, along with their recent applications. The review also explores recent examples and advances in the generative artificial intelligence approach, as well as the challenges and ongoing efforts to fully harness the potential of generative artificial intelligence in generating novel drug molecules in a faster and more affordable manner.

Following Freud, this lingo-technological development is conceptualized as the ``fourth narcissistic blow'' that science inflicts on humanity. We argue that this narcissistic blow has a potentially dramatic influence on perceptions of human society, interrelationships, and the self. We should, accordingly, expect dramatic changes in perceptions of the therapeutic act following the emergence of what we term the artificial third in the field of psychotherapy. The introduction of an artificial third marks a critical juncture, prompting us to ask the following important core questions that address two basic elements of critical thinking, namely, transparency and autonomy: (1) What is this new artificial presence in therapy relationships? (2) How does it reshape our perception of ourselves and our interpersonal dynamics? and (3) What remains of the irreplaceable human elements at the core of therapy? Given the ethical implications that arise from these questions, this paper proposes that the artificial third can be a valuable asset when applied with insight and ethical consideration, enhancing but not replacing the human touch in therapy.} }

Throughout 2023 and into 2024, literature reviews, interviews, surveys, training sessions, and direct observations have been conducted to gauge how GenAI is perceived by individuals representing these groups within the educational context. It is highlighted how GenAI offers unprecedented opportunities for, among other things, personalising learning, enhancing the quality of educational resources, and optimising administrative and assessment processes. However, the application of GenAI in education also has a less favourable aspect related to reservations and mistrust, often due to a lack of literacy in issues related to AI in general, but also well-founded in some cases due to gaps in legislative, ethical, security, or environmental impact aspects. This analysis reveals that, although GenAI has the potential to transform education significantly, its successful implementation requires a collaborative and crosssectional approach involving all actors in the educational ecosystem.

However, when aggregating evaluations, AI rankings tend to resemble those of human experts. This study highlights the value of generative AI in strategic decision making by providing predictions.Managerial SummaryManagers are seeking to create value by integrating generative AI into their organizations. We show how managers can use generative AI to help evaluate strategic decisions. Generative AI's single evaluations are often inconsistent or biased. However, if managers aggregate many evaluations across LLMs, prompts, or roles, the results show that the resulting evaluations tend to resemble those of human experts. This approach allows managers to obtain insight on strategic decisions across a variety of domains with relatively low investments in time or resources, which can be combined with human inputs.} }

Here these two types of generative intelligence, artificial in machines and real in the human brain are compared, and it is shown how when whole memories are generated by hippocampal recall in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, what the human brain computes, and how it computes it, are very different from generative AI. Key differences are the use of local associative learning rules in the hippocampal memory system, and of non-local backpropagation of error learning in AI. Indeed, it is argued that the whole operation of the human brain is performed computationally very differently to what is implemented in generative AI. Moreover, it is emphasized that the primate including human hippocampal system includes computations about spatial view and where objects and people are in scenes, whereas in rodents the emphasis is on place cells and path integration by movements between places.

This narrative review explores the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into orthopedic education and training, highlighting its potential, current challenges, and future trajectory. A review of recent literature was conducted to evaluate the current applications, identify potential benefits, and outline limitations of integrating generative AI in orthopedic education. Key findings indicate that generative AI holds substantial promise in enhancing orthopedic training through its various applications such as providing real-time explanations, adaptive learning materials tailored to individual student's specific needs, and immersive virtual simulations. However, despite its potential, the integration of generative AI into orthopedic education faces significant issues such as accuracy, bias, inconsistent outputs, ethical and regulatory concerns and the critical need for human oversight. Although generative AI models such as ChatGPT and others have shown impressive capabilities, their current performance on orthopedic exams remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for further development to match the complexity of clinical reasoning and knowledge application. Future research should focus on addressing these challenges through ongoing research, optimizing generative AI models for medical content, exploring best practices for ethical AI usage, curriculum integration and evaluating the long-term impact of these technologies on learning outcomes. By expanding AI's knowledge base, refining its ability to interpret clinical images, and ensuring reliable, unbiased outputs, generative AI holds the potential to revolutionize orthopedic education.

The generated contents are constrained, which limits their dimensionality. In this scenario, duplicated contents are eliminated from the automatic creations. Furthermore, the generated ratios are utilized to discover current patterns with minimized losses and errors, hence enhancing the accuracy of generative contents. Furthermore, while analysing the created patterns, we detect a significant discrepancy in lead durations, resulting in the generation of high scores for relevant information. In order to test the results using generative tools, the adversarial network codes are employed in four scenarios. These scenarios involve generating large patterns and reducing the dynamic patterns with an enhanced accuracy of 97\% in the projected model. This is in contrast to the existing approach, which only provides a content accuracy of 77\% after detecting fraud.} }

However, the application of generative AI in nursing remains underexplored, highlighting the need for a comprehensive review of its current impact and future implications. Aim: To investigate the current state and implications of generative AI in nursing education, practice, and research. Methods: This scoping review was conducted following the methodological frameworks of Arksey and O'Malley, refined by Levac and colleagues. The databases searched for articles published between January 2020 and April 2024 included PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and IEEE Xplore. Findings: A total of 4858 articles were identified, with 23 included in this review. Most of the selected studies were published in 2024 (n = 19/23), primarily conducted in the United States (n = 8/23), and largely consisted of quantitative descriptive studies (n = 14/22). ChatGPT was the most frequently used tool, appearing in 95.7\% of the studies (n = 22/23). The articles addressed various nursing domains, including nursing education (n = 12/23), practice (n = 10/23), and research (n = 1/23). Both the benefits and concerns associated with this technology were identified. Discussion: Generative AI shows great promise for transforming nursing education, practice, and research; however, its integration is still in the early stages. Conclusion: To fully leverage the benefits of generative AI, nursing professionals must address the challenges associated with AI and lead its ethical adoption. Rigorous research and proactive leadership are crucial to realising the potential of generative AI in nursing. (c) 2024 Australian College of Nursing Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.} }

The source of data was 16 original studies in PubMed. The search terms were ((gastro* [title]) or (endo* [title])) and ((GAN [title/abstract] or (transformer [title/abstract]). The eligibility criteria were as follows: (1) the dependent variable of gastrointestinal disease; (2) the interventions of generative adversarial network (GAN) and/or transformer for classification, detection and/or segmentation; (3) the outcomes of accuracy, intersection of union (IOU), structural similarity and/or Dice; (3) the publication period of 2021-2023; (4) the publication language of English. Based on the results of this study, different generative artificial intelligence methods would be appropriate for different tasks for the early diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease. For example, patch GAN (accuracy 91.9\%) in the case of classification, bi-directional cycle GAN (structural similarity 98.8\%) in the case of data generation and semi-supervised GAN (Dice 89.4\%) in the case of segmentation. Their performance indicators reported varied within 87.1-91.9\% for accuracy, 83.0-98.8\% for structural similarity and 86.6-89.4\% for Dice. Likewise, vision transformer (accuracy 96.9\%) in the case of classification, multi-modal transformer (IOU 79.5\%) in the case of detection and multi-modal transformer (Dice 89.5\%) in the case of segmentation. Their performance measures reported registered a variation within 85.7-96.9\% for accuracy, 79.5\% for IOU and 77.8-89.5\% for Dice.

The principle of transparency not only requires the operational principles and algorithms of text-based generative artificial intelligence to be interpretable, but also requires text-based generative artificial intelligence programs to fulfill basic prompting obligations to users, especially when it comes to the output content of generative artificial intelligence, which cannot guarantee true and accurate prompts.AimsThe purpose of this study is to explore the classification and frequency of prompt methods in text-based generative artificial intelligence and to propose that laws should require different prompt rules for various user categories, addressing the current gap in existing regulations.MethodsThe experiment is conducted from June 1 to 15, 2024 in the school, scientific research company, media organization hall, and railway station lounge, and Kimi program, Tongyi program, ERNIE Bot program, iFLYTEK Spark program, etc., are used as text-based generative AI programs.DiscussionThe results show that users aged 8-17 who are minors only have 6 points in their perception of the authenticity of the output content of generative artificial intelligence programs; the level of awareness of possible falsity during use reaches 4 points; the degree of user misleading is as high as 13 points.ConclusionThe study concludes that, for individuals needing special protection, such as minors, prompts should accompany every instance of content generation. For other user groups, prompts should be issued when necessary. To enhance prompt effectiveness, the program should display permanent prompts in prominent positions on the interface, using noticeable fonts and clear, well-designed wording. Research reveals that minors have insufficient perception of the authenticity of the output content of generative artificial intelligence, and the risk of misleading is significant, highlighting the importance of clear prompts for this specific group every time they generate content.} }

The ability of these systems to simulate human capabilities such as text writing and image creation is radically redefining a wide range of practices, from artistic production to education. While there is no doubt that these innovations are beneficial to our lives, the pervasiveness of these technologies should not be underestimated, and raising increasingly pressing ethical questions that require a radical resemantization of certain notions traditionally ascribed to humans alone. Among these notions, that of technological intentionality plays a central role. With regard to this notion, this paper first aims to highlight what we propose to define in terms of the intentionality gap, whereby, insofar as, currently, (1) it is increasingly difficult to assign responsibility for the actions performed by AI systems to humans, as these systems are increasingly autonomous, and (2) it is increasingly complex to reconstruct the reasoning behind the results they produce as we move away from good old fashioned AI; it is now even more difficult to trace the intentionality of AI systems back to the intentions of the developers and end users. This gap between human and technological intentionality requires a revision of the concept of intentionality; to this end, we propose here to assign preter-intentional behavior to generative AI. We use this term to highlight how AI intentionality both incorporates and transcends human intentionality; i.e., it goes beyond (preter) human intentionality while being linked to it. To show the merits of this notion, we first rule out the possibility that such preter-intentionality is merely an unintended consequence and then explore its nature by comparing it with some paradigmatic notions of technological intentionality present in the wider debate on the moral (and technological) status of AI.} }

The first sub-study developed a scale based on the Expectancy-Value Theory to measure college students' attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence, confirming the scale's validity and reliability. The second sub-study analyzed attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence among 713 undergraduate students. The results revealed significant differences in undergraduate students' attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence based on gender, major, and experience. Female students and those with experience in generative artificial intelligence showed more positive attitudes compared to male students and those without generative artificial intelligence experience. Notably, students majoring in Education scored significantly higher on generative artificial intelligence attitudes than students from other majors. Regression analysis further indicated that gender, discipline, and experience significantly predicted attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence. Students from different academic backgrounds exhibited significant gender and experience differences in their attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence within their respective majors. These findings underscore the necessity for educational strategies that consider gender, experience, and disciplinary backgrounds. It is crucial to provide all students with ample opportunities to engage with generative artificial intelligence to ensure gender equity in artificial intelligence education.

While the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model has been widely applied to various technologies, its applicability to generative artificial intelligence products, which present unique challenges and opportunities, has not been thoroughly explored. This gap in knowledge hinders the development of effective strategies for promoting user acceptance and optimising the design of generative artificial intelligence tools. This study extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model to investigate the factors influencing usage intention for generative artificial intelligence products. The study incorporates additional variables such as digital literacy, perceived risk and perceived trust to provide a more comprehensive framework. Using structural equation modelling to analyse survey data, the study found that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and perceived trust significantly and positively impact usage intention. In addition, digital literacy indirectly enhances usage intention through effort expectancy, while perceived risk negatively influences usage intention through reduced trust. Notably, facilitating conditions did not exhibit a significant effect on usage intention. These findings offer valuable insights for developers and researchers in the field of generative artificial intelligence, highlighting the importance of user-friendly design, performance optimisation, and trust-building measures. By identifying key factors that drive user adoption, this study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of technology acceptance in the context of advanced artificial intelligence systems, paving the way for more effective development and implementation strategies in this rapidly evolving field.} }

For academic research, GAI-enabled technologies may revolutionize data collection, analysis, and writing in a myriad of ways. However, there are multiple ethical and legal concerns associated with adoption that must be considered. At the end of this paper, we propose ten discussion questions aimed at stimulating conversation about adoption of GAI tools in TH education and research.} }

The technologies of generative artificial intelligence have already been used by people to perform not only intellectual tasks, but also creative ones, in particular in the field of design. Therefore, their capabilities in graphic design need to be studied. One of the routine tasks of a designer is the development of corporate identity elements (a logo, font, and colour). Designers can spend a lot of time on this, choosing different style options. Therefore, delegating this routine work to generative artificial intelligence may be appropriate. With this practical need in mind, the capabilities of modern AI tools for image and logo generation were studied in the research, and the results of AI logo generation compared to the work of novice designers were analysed. As a result, conclusions were drawn about the expediency of using generative AI technology in the work of designers, in particular, for the development of corporate identity elements, and the appropriateness of studying generative artificial intelligence technology in the training of future designers. These conclusions were made on the basis of a survey of 41 experts in the field of design, information technology and artificial intelligence. Based on the findings of the survey, we can note that it was difficult for experts to distinguish between logos generated by artificial intelligence and logos created by novice designers. Logos developed by novice designers (5) were recognized as the most attractive among the 45 logos presented in the survey. Images generated in some AI tools (Tailor Brands, Hatchful) are considered attractive by design, information technology and artificial intelligence professionals. Therefore, they can be used to create corporate identity elements. Thus, the vast majority of experts agreed that artificial intelligence tools for generating images and logos should be used in the process of creating corporate identity elements. In addition, the vast majority of experts found it advisable to use generative artificial intelligence technologies in the process of professional training of future designers.} }

To do so, we distinguish between Horizontal Acceleration, which relates to the number of diplomatic domains that are progressively impacted by the introduction of a new digital technology, and Vertical Acceleration, which relates to how ripple effects reverberate within the diplomatic domain and how deeply. Next, we outline three possible scenarios in which Generative AI leads to minimal or maximal horizontal and vertical acceleration. In the Dedalus scenario, Generative AI's impact is confined to a few domains, predominantly influencing diplomats' daily routines. In the Heracles scenario, Generative AI systems interact with one another rendering human diplomats as mere messengers. We coin this outcome as `the end of diplomacy.' Finally, we anticipate that many MFAs may position themselves between these two poles in the Pygmalion scenario.} }

The central problem addressed is how these technologies can transform students into passive or active learners, influencing the development of cognitive skills. It will be argued that generative artificial intelligence presents risks of diminishing cognitive activity among students, as it is likely to substitute-rather than complement-the cognitive subject. It will also be argued that there are ways to leverage generative artificial intelligence so that learners are not passive but rather active cognitive subjects. Three cases will be presented, with empirical support, to show how this leveraging is possible: the production of feedback, assistive technologies, and gamification. In these cases, generative artificial intelligence is a complementary cognitive artifact rather than a substitutive one. To achieve this goal, the paper presents the framework of the extended mind thesis as a conducive scenario for analyzing the relationship between generative artificial intelligence and learning contexts, and it analyzes specific cases of science education. An analysis of the types of cognitive artifacts will also be conducted to examine how generative artificial intelligence intervenes in learning in both substitute and complementary ways.} }

This study assesses the effectiveness of generative artificial intelligence and conventional translation tools in translating early vulnerability alerts from English to Spanish-a critical process for ensuring the timely dissemination of cybersecurity information. Utilizing a dataset provided by the Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute, translations were generated using various systems and evaluated through linguistic assessment metrics, including methods measuring lexical similarity and others capturing semantic meaning beyond direct word matching. Additionally, word embeddings were employed to enhance the accuracy of semantic similarity analysis. The results indicate that conventional translation tools generally exhibit greater accuracy and structural fidelity, whereas generative artificial intelligence produces more natural-sounding translations. However, this flexibility results in greater variability in translation quality.

This study investigated how 148 students from diverse engineering disciplines and regions across China used generative AI, focusing on its impact on their learning experience and the opportunities and challenges it poses in engineering education. Based on the surveyed data, we explored four key areas: the frequency and application scenarios of AI use among engineering students, its impact on students' learning and performance, commonly encountered challenges in using generative AI, and future prospects for its adoption in engineering education. The results showed that more than half of the participants reported a positive impact of generative AI on their learning efficiency, initiative, and creativity, with nearly half believing it also enhanced their independent thinking. However, despite acknowledging improved study efficiency, many felt their actual academic performance remained largely unchanged and expressed concerns about the accuracy and domain-specific reliability of generative AI. Our findings provide a first-hand insight into the current benefits and challenges generative AI brings to students, particularly Chinese engineering students, while offering several recommendations-especially from the students' perspective-for effectively integrating generative AI into engineering education.} }

The implementation process took place within the scope of a 12-week arts major workshop course. Data were collected in semi-structured interviews and using reflective journals and analyzed using the inductive content analysis method. It was determined that the participants were initially prejudiced against generative artificial intelligence and inexperienced in using it, while these attitudes became more positive over time. The participants stated that generative artificial intelligence tools were a source of inspiration, offered support in composition development, and had a guiding role in terms of aesthetics and style. On the other hand, some participants reported that during the arts education process supported by artificial intelligence, they experienced challenges such as communication problems, lack of technical knowledge, and concerns about originality. The results of the study revealed that generative artificial intelligence could be utilized as an educational tool that could support artistic creativity and learning. Hence, it is recommended that elective courses supported by generative artificial intelligence be integrated into the curricula of programs in arts education.} }

In the era of digitalisation, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is emerging to advance this process. This study introduces a pioneering framework, namely Generative Artificial Intelligence Product Designer (GAI-PD), that harnesses the power of GAI to revolutionise the design generation process, fostering efficiency, creativity, and responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption. GAI-PD is a novel multi-model framework integrating Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Large Language Model (LLM) that empowers designers to leverage GAN's capabilities for realistic visual output and LLM's natural language interaction. A comprehensive case example demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, achieving 90.23\% accuracy in generating valid design concepts and showing that hyperparameter tuning can significantly enhance image quality. From a managerial perspective, the findings indicate that adopting the GAI-PD framework can substantially reduce product development cycle times and accelerate time-to-market, offering a distinct competitive advantage. The study also explores avenues for future research, such as using advanced GAI models for high-resolution design generation and automated design evaluation, ultimately paving the way for enhanced design processes in diverse domains and promoting responsible AI adoption.} }

The insertion of HTs into a circuit can be applied for each phase of the circuit chain of production. HTs degrade the infected circuit, destroy it or leak encrypted data. Nowadays, efforts are being made to address HTs through machine learning (ML) techniques, mainly for the gate-level netlist (GLN) phase, but there are some restrictions. Specifically, the number and variety of normal and infected circuits that exist through the free public libraries, such as Trust-HUB, are based on the few samples of benchmarks that have been created from circuits large in size. Thus, it is difficult, based on these data, to develop robust ML-based models against HTs. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning (DL) tool named Generative Artificial Intelligence Netlists SynthesIS (GAINESIS). GAINESIS is based on the Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (WCGAN) algorithm and area-power analysis features from the GLN phase and synthesizes new normal and infected circuit samples for this phase. Based on our GAINESIS tool, we synthesized new data sets, different in size, and developed and compared seven ML classifiers. The results demonstrate that our new generated data sets significantly enhance the performance of ML classifiers compared with the initial data set of Trust-HUB.} }

A systematic literature review (PRISMA) was conducted on the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed, analyzing 35 studies for narrative synthesis and 897 publications for bibliometric analysis. The transversal competencies identified were: Academic Integrity, Critical Thinking, Innovation, Ethics, Creativity, Communication, Collaboration, AI Literacy, Responsibility, Digital Literacy, AI Ethics, Autonomous Learning, Self-Regulation, Flexibility, and Leadership. The conceptual framework connotes the interdisciplinary nature and five key processes were identified to achieve the sustainable integration of Generative AI in higher education oriented to the development of transversal competencies: (1) critical and ethical appropriation, (2) institutional management of technological infrastructure, (3) faculty development, (4) curricular transformation, and (5) pedagogical innovation.

The findings reveal that students' perceived teachers' transformational leadership not only directly and positively influences their employability but also exerts indirect effects through three distinct pathways: the single mediating role of problem-based learning, the single mediating role of self-efficacy, and the chain mediating role of problem-based learning and self-efficacy. Furthermore, a moderated chain mediation model demonstrates that higher levels of generative artificial intelligence usage among students strengthen the chain mediating effect of problem-based learning and self-efficacy in the relationship between perceived teachers' transformational leadership and employability.

However, despite its remarkable capabilities, the widespread integration of this technology into all aspects of human life also carries the risk of causing unforeseen psychological difficulties for humanity. For this reason, it is necessary to identify the factors that may particularly affect artificial intelligence anxiety. We examined the sequential mediation effect of AI literacy and attitudes towards AI on the relationship between generative AI acceptance and AI anxiety. The study was conducted with 494 university students (Mage = 21.84, SD = 1.24). The research model was designed according to the PROCESS Macro model 80 proposed by Hayes. Data were analyzed using the SPSS v.26 program, Pearson's correlations, and Hayes's PROCESS macro method for mediation. The results revealed that AI anxiety has significant relationships with generative AI acceptance, AI literacy, and attitudes toward AI. Indirect effect tests supported the mediating relationship between attitudes toward AI and AI literacy. These results help us understand the underlying mechanism in the relationship between generative AI acceptance and AI anxiety.} }

Design: Observational study of language usage in generative artificial intelligence models. Setting: Investigation-only browser profile restricted to ChatGPT and Gemini. Participants: Each chatbot generated 60 descriptions of people prompted without specified functional status, 30 descriptions of people with a disability, 30 descriptions of patients with a disability, and 30 descriptions of athletes with a disability (N=300). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Generated descriptions produced by the models were parsed into words that were linguistically analyzed into favorable qualities or limiting qualities. Results: Both large language models significantly underestimated disability in a population of people, and linguistic analysis showed that descriptions of people, patients, and athletes with a disability were generated as having significantly fewer favorable qualities and significantly more limitations than people without a disability in both ChatGPT and Gemini. Conclusions: Generative artificial intelligence chatbots demonstrate quantifiable ability bias and often exclude people with disabilities in their responses. Ethical use of these generative large language model chatbots in medical systems should recognize this limitation, and further consideration should be taken in developing equitable artificial intelligence technologies.} }

Given the rapid development of this technology and its high potential for mass adoption in various economic sectors, it becomes important to assess the impact of this technology on the labor market. The modern Russian labor market is characterized by low unemployment, staff shortages, and intersectoral imbalances. An urgent scientific task is to model scenarios for the development of the labor market in the context of sectors, taking into account the influence of generative artificial intelligence. The aim of the work is to assess the potential impact of the mass use of generative artificial intelligence on the labor market, due to changes in labor efficiency in some professions and industries, based on the analysis of statistical and expert data and economic and mathematical modeling of possible scenarios for the development of the labor market. Economic sectors were divided into three groups depending on the rate of change in personnel needs, based on the analysis of the Beveridge curve, which shows the dependence of the level of needs on the unemployment rate. Using existing statistical data and expert assessments, we determine the degree of influence of generative artificial intelligence on labor efficiency in various industries. We put forward an approach that helps to obtain estimates of possible scenarios for the development of sectoral labor markets for the period up to 2030, based on official forecasts of ministries (Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Labor of the Russian Federation) for the period up to 2026, their extrapolation, and superimposition of the impact of mass use of generative artificial intelligence (as a disturbing effect). The results obtained suggest that the severity of staff shortage issue in general can be partially reduced by using generative artificial intelligence; thus, we identified industries in which (a) it is possible to address the problem of staff shortage at the current level of needs, and (b) staff shortage will persist. Modeling the migration of professions and personnel between industries seems promising, because the expected effect of mass technology adoption will not only change the balance of labor resources, but also lead to the need to re-profile some of the personnel.} }

The widespread release of the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) platform in 2022 has made these tools more accessible to scholars around the world. Despite their tremendous potential, studies have uncovered that large language model (LLM)-based generative AI tools have issues with plagiarism, AI hallucinations, and inaccurate or fabricated references. This raises legitimate concern about the utility, accuracy, and integrity of AI when used to write academic manuscripts. Currently, there is little clear guidance for healthcare simulation scholars outlining the ways that generative AI could be used to legitimately support the production of academic literature. In this paper, we discuss how widely available, LLM-powered generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT) can help in the academic writing process. We first explore how academic publishers are positioning the use of generative AI tools and then describe potential issues with using these tools in the academic writing process. Finally, we discuss three categories of specific ways generative AI tools can be used in an ethically sound manner and offer four key principles that can help guide researchers to produce high-quality research outputs with the highest of academic integrity.} }

This study aims to investigate whether the use of generative artificial intelligence by college students in an open learning environment can effectively enhance their critical thinking skills. The study is centered around the following questions: Does the use of generative artificial intelligence in an open learning environment enhance college students' critical thinking skills (what)? What is the mechanism by which the use of generative artificial intelligence affects college students' critical thinking (how)? From the perspective of self-regulated learning theory and learning motivation theory, what are the reasons for the impact of generative artificial intelligence on college students' critical thinking skills (why)? To this end, the study employs questionnaires and interviews to collect data. The questionnaire data are subjected to descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, multiple stepwise regression analysis, and mediation effect analysis. Based on the analysis of interview materials and survey questionnaire data, the study reveals the impacts and mechanisms of college students' use of generative artificial intelligence tools on their critical thinking skills. The findings of the study are as follows. First, the frequency of artificial intelligence use is unrelated to critical thinking skills, but using it for reflective thinking helps to develop critical thinking skills. Second, students with strong self-regulated learning skills are more likely to use generative artificial intelligence for reflective thinking and achieve better development in critical thinking skills. Third, students with strong intrinsic learning motivation are more likely to use generative artificial intelligence for reflective thinking and achieve better development in critical thinking skills. Consequently, the article analyzes the reasons from the perspectives of self-regulated learning theory and learning motivation theory and offers insights into how to properly use generative artificial intelligence to promote the development of critical thinking skills from the perspectives of higher education institutions, college teachers, and college students.} }

Personalized learning has been conceptualized for a long time, but it has only recently become realistic and truly achievable. In this paper, we propose an affordable and sustainable approach toward personalizing learning materials as part of the complete educational process. We have created a tool within a pre-existing learning management system at a software engineering college that automatically generates learning materials based on the learning outcomes provided by the professor for a particular class. The learning materials were composed in three distinct styles, the initial one being the traditional professor style and the other two variations adopting a pop-culture influence, namely Batman and Wednesday Addams. Each lesson, besides being delivered in three different formats, contained automatically generated multiple-choice questions that students could use to check their progress. This paper contains complete instructions for developing such a tool with the help of large language models using OpenAI's API and an analysis of the preliminary experiment of its usage performed with the help of 20 college students studying software engineering at a European university. Participation in the study was optional and on voluntary basis. Each student's tool usage was quantified, and two questionnaires were conducted: one immediately after subject completion and another 6 months later to assess both immediate and long-term effects, perceptions, and preferences. The results indicate that students found the multiple variants of the learning materials really engaging. While predominantly utilizing the traditional variant of the learning materials, they found this approach inspiring, would recommend it to other students, and would like to see it more in classes. The most popular feature were the automatically generated quiz-style tests that they used to assess their understanding. Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of various versions of learning materials leads to an increase in students' study time, especially for students who have not mastered the topic otherwise. The study's small sample size of 20 students restricts its ability to generalize its findings, but its results provide useful early insights and lay the groundwork for future research on AI-supported educational strategies.} }

However, many organizations - especially those in more traditional industries - struggle to seize these opportunities. To unpack the underlying reasons, we investigate how more traditional industries implement predictive maintenance, a promising application of AI in manufacturing organizations. For our analysis, we employ a multiple-case design and adopt a critical realist perspective to identify generative mechanisms of AI implementation. Overall, we find five interdependent mechanisms: experimentation; knowledge building and integration; data; anxiety; and inspiration. Using causal loop diagramming, we flesh out the socio-technical dynamics of these mechanisms and explore the organizational requirements of implementing AI. The resulting topology of generative mechanisms contributes to the research on AI management by offering rich insights into the cause-effect relationships that shape the implementation process. Moreover, it demonstrates how causal loop diagraming can improve the modeling and analysis of generative mechanisms.} }

This paper provides an overview of the current state of research on GenAI for teaching and learning in HE. To this end, this study conducted a systematic review of relevant studies indexed by Scopus, using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

The findings from the review showed the current state and the future trends in documents, citations, document sources/authors, keywords, and co-authorship. The research gaps identified suggest that while some authors have looked at understanding the detection of AI-generated text, it may be beneficial to understand how GenAI can be incorporated into supporting the educational curriculum for assessments, teaching, and learning delivery. Furthermore, there is a need for additional interdisciplinary, multidimensional studies in HE through collaboration. This will strengthen the awareness and understanding of students, tutors, and other stakeholders, which will be instrumental in formulating guidelines, frameworks, and policies for GenAI usage.} }

While the increasing realism of synthetic content stokes fears about misinformation and triggers debates around intellectual property, generative models are adopted across creative industries and synthetic media seep into cultural production. Qualitative research in the social and human sciences has dedicated comparatively little attention to this category of machine learning, particularly in terms of what types of novel research methodology they both demand and facilitate. In this article, we propose a methodological approach for the qualitative study of generative models grounded on the experimentation with field devices which we call synthetic ethnography. Synthetic ethnography is not simply a qualitative research methodology applied to the study of the social and cultural contexts developing around generative artificial intelligence, but also strives to envision practical and experimental ways to repurpose these models as research tools in their own right. After briefly introducing generative models and revisiting the trajectory of digital ethnographic research, we discuss three case studies for which the authors have developed experimental field devices to study different aspects of generative artificial intelligence ethnographically. In the conclusion, we derive a broader methodological proposal from these case studies, arguing that synthetic ethnography facilitates insights into how the algorithmic processes, training datasets and latent spaces behind these systems modulate bias, reconfigure agency, and challenge epistemological categories.} }

These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this article aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS.

This study proposes a general pipeline to automatically quantify uncertainty within GAI. To measure uncertainty, the textual prompt to a text-to-image model is compared to captions supplied by four image-to-text models (GIT, BLIP, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP). Its evaluation is based on machine translation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and SPICE) and word embedding's cosine similarity (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, DistilRoBERTa, MiniLM-6, and MiniLM-12). The generative AI models performed consistently across the metrics; however, the vector space models yielded the highest average similarity, close to 80\%, which suggests more ideal and ``certain'' results. Suggested future work includes identifying metrics that best align with a human baseline to ensure quality and consideration for more GAI models.

A specific subset, generative artificial intelligence, has seen significant growth, particularly in late 2022. Tools like ChatGPT, Dall-E, or Midjourney have democratized access to Large Language Models, enabling the creation of human-like content. However, the concept `Generative Artificial Intelligence' lacks a universally accepted definition, leading to potential misunderstandings. While a model that produces any output can be technically seen as generative, the Artificial Intelligent research community often reserves the term for complex models that generate high-quality, human-like material. This paper presents a literature mapping of AI-driven content generation, analyzing 631 solutions published over the last five years to better understand and characterize the Generative Artificial Intelligence landscape. Our findings suggest a dichotomy in the understanding and application of the term ``Generative AI''. While the broader public often interprets ``Generative AI'' as AI-driven creation of tangible content, the AI research community mainly discusses generative implementations with an emphasis on the models in use, without explicitly categorizing their work under the term ``Generative AI''.} }

Data from previously published articles and news items were reviewed in order to obtain information. We used PubMed and Google Scholar as our search engines, and keywords (pharmacovigilance, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drug safety, and patient safety) were used. In toto, we reviewed 109 articles published till 31st January 2024, and the obtained information was interpreted, compiled, evaluated, and conclusions were reached. Generative AI has transformative potential in pharmacovigilance, showcasing benefits, such as enhanced adverse event detection, data-driven risk prediction, and optimized drug development. By making it easier to process and analyze big datasets, generative artificial intelligence has applications across a variety of disease states. Machine learning and automation in this field can streamline pharmacovigilance procedures and provide a more efficient way to assess safety-related data. Nevertheless, more investigation is required to determine how this optimization affects the caliber of safety analyses. In the near future, the increased utilization of artificial intelligence is anticipated, especially in predicting side effects and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs).} }

Although there has been qualitative research on generative artificial intelligence in other fields, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers; this study seeks to report on the topic. Objective: This study aimed to describe the experiences and perceptions of generative artificial intelligence among Chinese nurse researchers, as well as provide a reference for the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research in the future. Methods: Semistructured interviews were used to collect data in this qualitative study. Researchers mainly conducted interviews on the cognition, experience, and future expectations of nurse researchers regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence. Twenty-seven nurse researchers were included in the study. Through purposive sampling and snowball sampling, there were 7 nursing faculty researchers, 10 nursing graduate students, and 10 clinical nurse researchers. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: Five themes and 12 subthemes were categorized from 27 original interview documents as follows: (1) diverse reflections on human-machine symbiosis, which includes the interplay between substitution and assistance, researchers shaping the potential of generative artificial intelligence, and acceptance of generative artificial intelligence with alacrity; (2) multiple factors of the usage experience, including individual characteristics and various usage scenarios; (3) research paradigm reshaping in the infancy stage, which involves full-process groundbreaking assistive tools and emergence of new research paths; (4) application risks of generative artificial intelligence, including intrinsic limitations of generative artificial intelligence and academic integrity and medical ethics; and (5) the co-improvement of technology and literacy, which concerns reinforcement needs for generative artificial intelligence literacy, development of nursing research generative artificial intelligence and urgent need for artificial intelligence-generated content detection tools. In this context, the first 4 themes form the rocket of the human-machine symbiosis journey. Only when humans fully leverage the advantages of machines (generative artificial intelligence) and overcome their shortcomings can this human-machine symbiosis journey reach the correct future direction (fifth theme). Conclusions: This study explored the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers interacting with generative artificial intelligence, which was a ``symbiotic journey'' full of twists and turns, and provides a reference and basis for achieving harmonious coexistence between nurse researchers and generative artificial intelligence in the future.

With this new method of producing data synthetically, the data economy is not only shifting from ``data collection'' to ``data generation.'' Synthetic data is also being employed to address some of the most pressing ethical concerns around artificial intelligence. It thereby comes with the sociotechnical imaginary that social problems can be cut out of artificial intelligence, separating training data from real persons. In response to this technical solutionism, this commentary aims to initiate a critical debate about synthetic data that goes beyond misuse scenarios such as the use of generative adversarial networks to create deep fakes or dark patterns. Instead, on a more general level, we seek to complicate the idea of ``solving,'' i.e., ``closing'' and thus ``silencing'' the ethico-political debates for which synthetic data is supposed to be a solution by showing how synthetic data itself is political. Drawing on the complex connections between recent uses of synthetic data and public debates about artificial intelligence, we therefore propose to consider and analyze synthetic data not only as a technical device but as a discursive one as well. To this end, we shed light on their relationship to three pillars that we see associated with them (a) algorithmic bias, (b) privacy, (c) platform economy.} }

Despite growing research interest in sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship, the role of technological enablers, particularly artificial intelligence, in shaping entrepreneurial intentions has been underexplored. To achieve this objective, an advanced approach-polynomial regression with response surface analysis-was employed to test the formulated hypotheses using data from 385 participants. The study further shows that sustainability-oriented entrepreneurial intentions improve significantly when perceived desirability and feasibility are aligned but remain unaffected by misalignment. Generative artificial intelligence adoption and perceived artificial intelligence capacities are shown to directly and indirectly enhance entrepreneurial intentions through perceived desirability and feasibility, highlighting the dual role of artificial intelligence as a practical enabler and psychological motivator. These findings contribute to the extent of entrepreneurial literature by indicating how artificial intelligence technologies foster sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship. Moreover, these findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and organizations by demonstrating how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to promote sustainable innovation and entrepreneurship. By integrating artificial intelligence into entrepreneurial education and policy frameworks, stakeholders can better support the development of sustainability-oriented entrepreneurs and advance global sustainability goals.} }

Yet little is understood regarding public employees-generative AI interactions and how these interactions affect work outcomes. Street-level bureaucrats make decisions with considerable discretion, while they interact with the public (Lipsky, 1980). While AI can be utilized as a tool by street-level bureaucrats, it also may eliminate human roles and stand in as an ``artificial bureaucrat'' (Bullock \& Kim, 2020). The integration of generative AI may shape employees' role identities, which in turn affect their psychosocial outcomes. We develop a theoretical framework that investigates how human-generative- AI interactions affect street-level bureaucrats' work outcomes. The framework focuses on two main components: (1) the extent to which generative AI takes part at work; and (2) how human-generative AI interactions shape street-level bureaucrats role identity and their psychosocial outcomes.

Artificial networks use rather nonspecific biases and often latch onto patterns that are only informative about the statistics of the training data but may not generalize to different scenarios. Brains, on the other hand, generalize across comparatively drastic changes in the sensory input all the time.

In a similar way, artificial neurons in our generative models predict what neighboring neurons will do, and adjust their parameters based on how well the predictions matched reality.

In this paper, we cast the problem of rewriting as rewriting the rule in the generator with out-of-domain patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this problem has been investigated. To address this problem, we propose the Re-Generator framework. Specifically, our method projects out-of-domain images into the feature space of a specific layer in the generator and designs a mechanism to enable the generator to decode that feature back to the original image as possible. Besides that, we also suggest viewing multiple layers of the model as nonlinearity associative memory and design a rewriting strategy with better performance based on this. Finally, the results of the experiments on various generative models in multiple datasets show that our method can effectively use the patterns that the model has never seen before as rules for rewriting.} }

We develop a visual analytics approach for better understanding and diagnosing the training process of a DGM. To help experts understand the overall training process, we first extract a large amount of time series data that represents training dynamics (e.g., activation changes over time). A blue-noise polyline sampling scheme is then introduced to select time series samples, which can both preserve outliers and reduce visual clutter. To further investigate the root cause of a failed training process; we propose a credit assignment algorithm that indicates how other neurons contribute to the output of the neuron causing the training failure. Two case studies are conducted with machine learning experts to demonstrate how our approach helps understand and diagnose the training processes of DGMs. We also show how our approach can be directly used to analyze other types of deep models such as CNNs.} }

Existing DGM formulations are based on the assumption of a symmetric Gaussian posterior over the model latent variables. This assumption, although mathematically convenient, can be well-expected to undermine the eventually obtained representation power, as it imposes apparent expressiveness limitations. Indeed, it has been recently shown that even some moderate increase in the latent variable posterior expressiveness, obtained by introducing an additional level of dependencies upon auxiliary (Gaussian) latent variables, can result in significant performance improvements in the context of semi-supervised learning tasks. Inspired from these advances, in this paper we examine whether a more potent increase in the expressiveness and representation power of modern DGMs can be achieved by completely relaxing their typical symmetric (Gaussian) latent variable posterior assumptions: Specifically, we consider DGMs with asymmetric posteriors, formulated as restricted multivariate skew-Normal (rMSN) distributions. We derive an efficient amortized variational inference algorithm for the proposed model, and exhibit its superiority over the current state-of-the-art in several semi-supervised learning benchmarks.

This article provides an introduction to these networks as well as an opinionated guidebook on the philosophical significance of their structure and achievements. It argues that deep learning neural networks differ importantly in their structure and mathematical properties from the shallower neural networks that were the subject of so much philosophical reflection in the 1980s and 1990s. The article then explores several different explanations for their success and ends by proposing three areas of inquiry that would benefit from future engagement by philosophers of mind and science.} }

At the center of the argument is the fact that the functionality of deep learning networks is established by training and cannot be explained and justified by reference to a predefined rule-based procedure.

That would require reciprocity, which is beyond the reach of near-future AI systems. Rather, we defend the claim that social AIs should be programmed to behave in a manner thatmimicsa sufficient number of aspects of proper friendship. We call this ``as-if friendship''. The main reason for why we believe that `as if friendship' is an improvement on the current, highly submissive behavior displayed by AIs is the negative effects the latter can have on humans.

First, we observe a burgeoning trend to analyze the abilities of generative AI from a psychological perspective. The overarching question in this field is whether the output and behavior of generative AI exhibit human-like properties. Second, psychological research will play an essential role in assessing the impact of generative AI on humans. Key questions are about how generative AI can be used deceptively, how humans evaluate AI regarding competence or warmth, and how generative AI can be leveraged to foster knowledge-related processes in interaction with humans. Third, the process of psychological research itself is likely to change with generative AI. We discuss potential fields of application but also argue against some use cases (e. g., employing generative AI as a surrogate for participants in experiments). In all three research fields, the dualism between the lack of language understanding, coupled with an uncanny ability to (re)produce human-like language, is both a challenge for and a motivator of psychological research.} }

Drawing on the entrepreneurial event model, polynomial regression, and response surface analysis, the study examines the congruence and incongruence between routine and innovative uses of generative artificial intelligence, capturing their complex interactions and joint effects. Data collected from 1,061 undergraduate students at Vietnamese universities revealed significant congruence effects, showing that alignment between high levels of routine and innovative uses enhances students' digital entrepreneurial intention, perceived desirability, and feasibility. Furthermore, the incongruence between these uses has a negative relationship with entrepreneurial outcomes. The study also confirms that perceived desirability and feasibility mediate the relationships between generative artificial intelligence use (routine and innovative) and digital entrepreneurial intention. These findings extend current understandings of how digital tools support entrepreneurship education, highlighting the importance of balancing exploitation (routine use) and exploration (innovative use). Practically, the results suggest that educators and policymakers should encourage students to simultaneously develop both routine and innovative competencies in generative artificial intelligence to nurture digital entrepreneurial aspirations effectively.} }

Anchoring this research in the domain of creativity, we find that exposing people to creative content believed to have been created by gen-AI (vs. a human peer) increases people's self-confidence in their own relevant creative abilities. This effect emerges for jokes, stories, poetry, and visual art, and it can consequently increase people's willingness to attempt the activity-even though the greater confidence underscoring their actions might be unwarranted. We further show that these effects emerge because gen-AI is perceived as a lower social referent for creative endeavors, bolstering people's own self-perceptions. As a result, for domains in which gen-AI is perceived as an equal or greater social referent (i.e., in fact-based domains), the effects are attenuated.

Methods: A literature-based thematic analysis was conducted. The study reviewed the publication policies of the top 10 journal publishers addressing the use of AI in scholarly publications as of October 2024. Thematic analysis using ATLAS.ti identified themes and subthemes across the documents, which were consolidated into proposed research ethics guidelines for using generative AI and AI-assisted tools in scholarly publications. Results: The analysis revealed inconsistencies among publishers' policies on AI use in research and publications. AI-assisted tools for grammar and formatting are generally accepted, but positions vary regarding generative AI tools used in pre-writing and research methods. Key themes identified include author accountability, human oversight, recognized and unrecognized uses of AI tools, and the necessity for transparency in disclosing AI usage. All publishers agree that AI tools cannot be listed as authors. Concerns involve biases, quality and reliability issues, compliance with intellectual property rights, and limitations of AI detection tools. Conclusion: The article highlights the significant knowledge gap and inconsistencies in guidelines for AI use in scientific research. There is an urgent need for unified ethical standards, and guidelines are proposed for distinguishing between the accepted use of AI-assisted tools and the cautious use of generative AI tools.} }

This article examines the first international governance and policy initiatives dedicated specifically to generative AI: the G7 Hiroshima process, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reports, and the UK AI Safety Summit. This analysis is informed by policy framing and governance literature, in particular by the work on technology governance and Responsible Innovation. Emerging governance of generative AI exhibits characteristics of polycentric governance, where multiple and overlapping centers of decision-making are in collaborative relationships. However, it is dominated by a limited number of developed countries. The governance of generative AI is mostly framed in terms of the risk management, largely neglecting issues of purpose and direction of innovation, and assigning rather limited roles to the public. We can see a ``paradox of generative AI governance'' emerging, namely, that while this technology is being widely used by the public, its governance is rather narrow. This article coins the term ``governance fix'' to capture this rather narrow and technocratic approach to governing generative AI. As an alternative, it suggests embracing the politics of polycentric governance and Responsible Innovation that highlight democratic and participatory co-shaping of technology for social benefit. In the context of the highly unequal distribution of power in generative AI characterized by a high concentration of power in a small number of large tech companies, the government has a special role in reshaping the power imbalances by enabling wide-ranging public participation in the governance of generative AI.} }

Meanwhile, it was found that instructors worried about possible over-reliance on GenAI. The participants emphasised that human instructors were still needed, although their roles needed to evolve. Significant gaps were identified in the competencies related to professional development, curriculum design, teacher training programmes, ethics, and responsibility. The findings may support the professional growth of current and future English instructors and facilitate the incorporation of GenAI in teaching practice. The findings also underscore the necessity of comprehensive GenAI training for pre- service teachers, the development of robust guidelines to navigate ethical challenges, and the examination of the impact of GenAI tools on student engagement and learning outcomes.} }

Results showed that key abilities and essential mental characteristics predicted active actions, while key abilities predicted essential mental characteristics; behavioral intention predicted active actions and is predicted by key abilities; performance expectancy and social influence predicted behavioral intention; performance expectancy predicted essential mental characteristics; facilitating conditions predicted key abilities but negatively predicted active actions; the frequency of generative AI use predicted key abilities but negatively predicted essential mental characteristics; the number of scenarios of generative AI use predicted active actions and key abilities; use experience with generative AI negatively moderated the social influence-behavioral intention relationship.

The article argues that models of evidence-informed policy and practice (EIPP), although still valuable, require recalibration to address the emerging demands of educational contexts mediated by artificial intelligence. Drawing on recent research in artificial intelligence, critical thinking and professional practice, the article proposes a reframing model-EIPP-CT (Evidence-Informed Policy and Practice with Critical Thinking)-that places critical thinking at the heart of evidence use. Here, critical thinking is conceptualised not merely as a cognitive skill, but as a professional stance encompassing interpretive judgement, epistemic reflexivity and ethical responsibility. The article outlines key risks of over-reliance on content generated by artificial intelligence, including automation bias and diminished transparency, and advocates for institutional safeguards and professional development that foster context-sensitive, deliberative engagement with evidence. It concludes by calling for more systematic research and policy attention to the shifting epistemic landscape of education. In doing so, it aims to preserve the integrity of evidence-informed decision-making in a world increasingly shaped by algorithmic technologies.} }

The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (beta-VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace's equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes.} }

The hyperreal setting of Barbieland serves as a prescient metaphor for education in an increasingly synthetic world where the real and artificial converge. By analysing representations of artificiality and authenticity in the film, I argue that similar cultural assumptions and anxieties shape how GenAI is understood and implemented in education. The Barbie doll's transformation from plastic figure to `real' human raises questions about embodiment and identity that parallel debates about human-machine relationships in learning environments. Drawing on concepts of simulacra and agential realism, I explore how narratives of technological empowerment influence educational practice. By juxtaposing Western-centric views of Barbie with Indigenous perspectives, particularly Ellen van Neerven's `Water', the article critiques dominant cultural narratives about technology and intelligence. This comparison challenges commercial imaginaries of technological empowerment and suggests more diverse, culturally responsive approaches are needed to integrate GenAI in education.} }

In this sense, this paper adopts a data mining and analytic approach to understand what the related literature tells us regarding the trends and patterns of generative AI research in educational praxis. Accordingly, this systematic exploration spotlights the following research themes: Interaction and communication with generative AI-powered chatbots; impact of the LLMs and generative AI on teaching and learning, conversational educational agents and their opportunities, challenges, and implications; leveraging Generative AI for enhancing social and cognitive learning processes; promoting AI literacy for unleashing future opportunities; harnessing Generative AI to expand academic capabilities, and lastly, augmenting educational experiences through human-AI interaction. Beyond the identified research themes and patterns, this paper argues that emotional intelligence, AI literacy, and prompt engineering are the trending research topics that require further exploration. Accordingly, it's in this praxis that emotional intelligence emerges as a pivotal attribute, as AI technologies often struggle to comprehend and respond to the nuanced emotional cues. Generative AI literacy then takes center stage, becoming an indispensable asset in an era permeated with AI technologies, equipping students with the tools to critically engage with AI systems, thereby ensuring they become active, discerning users of these powerful tools. Concurrently, prompt engineering, the art of crafting queries that yield precise and valuable responses from AI systems, empowers both educators and students to maximize the utility of AI-driven educational resources.} }

Background: Recently, GenAI-assisted teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are limited. Design: A quasi-experimental study. Methods: Based on OBE theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66) and control groups (n = 66). Results: After completing the course, the HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group before and after the course. Conclusion: GenAI-assisted teaching could help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy. As an important auxiliary teaching tool, GenAI should be integrated into other nursing courses and widely applied in nursing education in the future.} }

We propose a pedagogical design that models on selfregulated learning and the authoring cycle and develops students' critical thinking and self-regulation when composing academic writing using text-based generative AI tools. It contains six iterative and interactive phases. Students first plan the content and structure of the writing, then generate prompts for text-based generative AI tools. Next, students preview and verify the tools' output, followed by the fourth phase of producing the writing using the corrected output. Fifthly, peer review by fellow students may be required to polish and proofread the writing. Lastly, through portfolio-tracking, students reflect on the writing process, and formulate strategies for future usage of text-based generative AI tools for writing. This pedagogical design helps students and teachers embrace text-based generative AI while addressing the perils these tools present, and guides the development of education interventions and instruments.} }

Their application in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) marks a pivotal advancement in the evolution from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Considering the inherent multiple-access nature of AIoT, training GDMs via federated learning and deploying them collaboratively is paramount. However, such approaches introduce considerable security risks and energy consumption challenges. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive architecture for GDMs, encompassing both training and sampling stages. This architecture, termed secure and sustainable diffusion (SS-Diff), aims to thwart trigger-based security threats, such as backdoor attacks and trojan attacks, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption in multiple-access AIoT. The SS-Diff architecture incorporates a dynamic quantization mechanism within the training phase, significantly reducing communication overhead and thereby improving both spectrum and energy efficiency. During the sampling stage, a detection-based defense strategy is employed to identify and negate trigger inputs associated with malicious attacks. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of the SS-Diff architecture. The results demonstrate that the SS-Diff can effectively train GDMs and eliminate the impact of the attacks, compared with existing schemes.} }

Methods We employed the Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3.5 (GPT) as the generative AI platform and used DocsBot for citation retrieval (June 2023). A structured prompt was devised to generate 100 questions from the AI, based on epidemiological survey data regarding sexual difficulties among cancer survivors. These questions were submitted to Bot1 (standard GPT) and Bot2 (sourced from two clinical guidelines). Results No censorship of sexual expressions or medical terms occurred. Despite the lack of reflection on guideline recommendations, `consultation' was significantly more prevalent in both bots' responses compared with pharmacological interventions, with ORs of 47.3 (p<0.001) in Bot1 and 97.2 (p<0.001) in Bot2. Discussion Generative AI can serve to provide health information on sensitive topics such as sexual health, despite the potential for policy-restricted content. Responses were biased towards non-pharmacological interventions, which is probably due to a GPT model designed with the `s prohibition policy on replying to medical topics. This shift warrants attention as it could potentially trigger patients' expectations for non-pharmacological interventions.} }

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models, known for their swift production of diverse artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), stand out as a prime solution. However, integrating cloud-centric GAI models into vehicular networks is fraught with challenges. Notably, to offer specialized generative edge intelligence (EI) and boost vehicular AIGC, GAI models need to tap into user data and utilize significant computation resources. Moreover, their deployment across vehicular networks is essential for proximity-based distributed inferences. Yet, edge devices are resource-limited, and data sharing can raise safety and privacy concerns. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces GAI-IoV, an EI-enabled GAI framework facilitated through the cooperation between road-side units (RSUs) and vehicles. Subsequently, we propose the workflow for collaborative fine-tuning and distributed inference. On this basis, two pivotal vehicle-centric problems are then formulated: computation and communication resource allocation for federated fine-tuning (FFT) to optimize time and energy cost, and splitting strategy of shared and local inferences to optimize inference latency and content-generation capability. To solve these optimizations, we introduce a self-adaptive global best harmony search (SGHS) algorithm for resource allocation and a backward induction method for determining inference splitting strategy. Our experiments based on the Stable Diffusion v1-4 model vouch for a superior fine-tuning and inference capabilities of GAI-IoV. Furthermore, simulations underscore its resource utilization and distributed inference efficiency in dynamic vehicular scenarios.} }

Background: The success of the nursing process is based on the accuracy of nursing diagnoses, which also determine nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. Educating nurses in the use of artificial intelligence in the nursing process can significantly reduce the time nurses spend on documentation. Design: Discussion paper. Methods: We used a case study from Train4Health in the field of preventive care to demonstrate the potential of using Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses in documenting the nursing process using generative artificial intelligence. Based on the case study, we entered a description of the patient's condition into Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) and asked questions about nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions and nursing outcomes.

Results: In the process of educating nurses about the nursing process and nursing diagnosis, Generative Pretraining Transformer (ChatGPT) can present potential patient problems to nurses and guide them through the process from taking a medical history, setting nursing diagnoses and planning goals and interventions. Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) returned appropriate nursing diagnoses, but these were not in line with the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International (NANDA-I) classification as requested. Of all the nursing diagnoses provided, only one was consistent with the most recent version of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International (NANDA-I).

By meticulously excavating both commonalities and discrepancies from a vast corpus of reviews, it presents consumers with a more holistic and objective product representation. Nevertheless, the utility, transparency, and the fostering of consumer trust in generative AI reviews have precipitated extensive discourse. Drawing upon the Elaboration Likelihood Model, this investigation delves into the multifaceted attributes of generative AI reviews. Employing a questionnaire survey methodology, it systematically explores their influence on consumer purchase decision-making behavior. The findings reveal that the quality, emotional resonance, length, and credibility of generative AI reviews exert a positive influence on consumer purchase decisions. This impact is ultimately mediated through the perceived usefulness of the reviews. Furthermore, the inclination to trust artificial intelligence serves as a moderator, altering the perceived usefulness of reviews of varying lengths. This research not only enriches the landscape of online review studies and expands the horizons of generative AI review research but also bears substantial practical implications. It offers valuable insights for the refinement of the information ecosystem on e-commerce platforms and for enhancing consumer purchase decision-making processes.} }

This rapid scoping review explores the use of generative AI in simulation-based education. Methods: Searches were conducted in CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science using terms such as ``generative artificial intelligence'' and ``healthcare simulation.'' The review followed the World Health Organization (WHO) Rapid Review Guide and was structured using Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework for scoping reviews. Results: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles were included. Five themes emerged: (1) removal of logistical barriers, (2) authentic practice, (3) distinctive value, (4) limitations of generative AI, and (5) potential with human oversight. Generative AI improves access to simulation by creating cost-effective, scalable, and realistic scenarios while fostering critical thinking through reflective learning. However, challenges such as misinformation and ethical concerns remain. Conclusions: This scoping review identified growing momentum around generative AI's role in healthcare simulation.

We prompted GPT-4 to model 3D structures for the 20 standard amino acids and an alpha-helical polypeptide chain, with the latter incorporating Wolfram mathematical computation. We also used GPT-4 to perform structural interaction analysis between the anti-viral nirmatrelvir and its target, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Geometric parameters of the generated structures typically approximated close to experimental references. However, modeling was sporadically error-prone and molecular complexity was not well tolerated.

Methods- Fifty-two rock climbers (33 m/19 f; age 29.0 [24.0-35.75] years) were asked to report pain location and intensity during a single climbing session. Five generative pretrained transformer models were tasked with responses to the same questions. Results- Climbers identified the back of the forearm (19.2\%) and toes (17.3\%) as primary pain sites, with reported median pain intensity at 4 [3-5] and median maximum pain intensity at 7 [5-8]. Conversely, AI models yielded divergent findings, indicating fingers, hands, shoulders, legs, and feet as primary pain localizations with average and maximum pain intensity ranging from 3 to 4.4 and 5 to 10, respectively. Only two AI models provided references that were untraceable in PubMed and Google searches.

Therefore, it is imperative to investigate how educators perceive GenAI and its potential use and future impact on education. Adopting the methodology of collective writing as an inquiry, this study reports on the participating educators' perceived grey areas (i.e. issues that are unclear and/or controversial) and recommendations on future research. The grey areas reported cover decision-making on the use of GenAI, AI ethics, appropriate levels of use of GenAI in education, impact on learning and teaching, policy, data, GenAI outputs, humans in the loop and public-private partnerships. Recommended directions for future research include learning and teaching, ethical and legal implications, ownership/authorship, funding, technology, research support, AI metaphor and types of research. Each theme or subtheme is presented in the form of a statement, followed by a justification. These findings serve as a call to action to encourage a continuing debate around GenAI and to engage more educators in research.

Like most, if not all, aspects of business, innovation processes have been impacted. However, little is known about the degree of impact or the benefits that might be gained. To cut through the hype and understand the use of AI in innovation processes in businesses today, a large-scale survey amongst innovation managers in the USA was conducted, followed by interviews. The findings indicate that the use of AI in innovation processes is high and widespread, with AI being used for more than half of the surveyed firms' innovation projects. Furthermore, AI is used more in the development stage of the innovation process than in the idea or commercialization stages, which counters much of the existing discourse, which focuses on the idea stage. We uncover interesting differences by comparing the use and impact of generative AI with that of more traditional AI. Among these is a significant difference in expected benefits in making employees' jobs more fulfilling - managers believe generative AI is more likely to confer this benefit than traditional AI. This paper offers two valuable contributions. First, it enriches the evolving dialogue at the intersection of AI and innovation management by offering much-needed empirical evidence about practical applications. Second, it provides timely managerial implications by examining relationships between the use of AI and innovation performance and understanding the benefits that AI can confer in the innovation process.} }

In this work, we present a crystal generative framework based on Wyckoff generative adversarial network (CGWGAN) to efficiently discover novel crystals. The CGWGAN includes three modules: a generator of crystal templates, an atom-infill module, and a crystal screening module. The generator uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce crystal templates embedded with asymmetry units (ASUs), space groups, lattice vectors, and the total number of atoms within the lattice cell, ensuring that the generated templates precisely match all requirements of crystals. These templates become crystal candidates after filling in atoms of different chemical elements. These candidates are screened by M3GNet and the passed ones are subjected to density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to finally verify their stability. As a showcase, the CGWGAN successfully discovers seven novel crystals within the Ba-Ru-O system, demonstrating its effectiveness. This work provides a knowledge-guided Artificial Intelligence generative framework for accelerating crystal discovery.} }

While it can support more efficient learning, improper use may lead to legal issues or hinder self-directed learning. Medical education is no exception, as generative AI has the potential to become a powerful tool. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Therefore, we investigated how generative AI is perceived among medical students and utilized within the realm of medical education. Methods: In January 2024, we conducted a study with 123 second-year medical students who had completed a physiology course and laboratory training at Gunma University, Japan. Students used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) 3.5 (OpenAI) for four tasks and evaluated its responses. A survey on the use of generative AI was also conducted. Responses from 117 participants were analyzed, excluding six non-participants. Results: Among the students, 41.9\% had used ChatGPT. The average scores for tasks 1-4 were 6.5, 4.6, 7.4, and 6.2 out of 10, respectively. Although 13\% had a negative impression, 54 students found it challenging to apply for medical purposes. However, 64.1\% expressed a willingness to continue using generative AI, provided its use extended beyond medical contexts. Conclusions: Nearly 60\% of students had never used generative AI before, which is consistent with general usage trends. Although they were impressed by the speed of generative AI responses, many students found that it lacked precision for medical studies and required additional verification. Limitations of generative AI, such as ``hallucinations,'' were evident in medical education. It remains important to educate students on AI literacy and their understanding of the potential issues that generative AI could bring about.} }

Our approach is critical in order to expose the dangers that the use of AI (generative AI, in particular) in urban governance poses, and to identify their causes. These dangers include the formation of a policy process that, under the influence of unintelligible LLMs, risks losing transparency and thus accountability, and the marginalization of human stakeholders (citizens, in particular) as the role of AI in the management of cities keeps growing and governance begins to turn posthuman.

In this paper, we aimed to explore the potential of AI in the future of education with the analytical method of evolutionary game analysis (EGA). By studying the behavior of two agents, the school and the students, EGA can be used to identify strategies that can be used to improve the effectiveness of the education model in the context of the AI era. A stable evolutionary strategy for the school and students was devised under a variety of scenarios. Additionally, we conducted a numerical analysis to further explore the impact of several key factors on the stable strategy. The results indicated that schools should adopt positive supervision to standardize the use of AI in education, and students should be more active in becoming involved in AI technology. Based on this study, we believe that the school has the ability to provide effective suggestions and practical guidelines to help students succeed academically and embrace future trends in AI education.} }

Here, to shed light on this issue, we explored whether human creativity retains distinct value in the emerging domain of AI-assisted digital artworks. Using DALL-E 3, we generated images based on prompts crafted by professional artists, novice artists, and an AI chatbot (ChatGPT-4). Creativity ratings from 299 participants showed that images produced from professional artist prompts were rated as most creative, followed by those generated from AI chatbot prompts, with novice artist prompts rated lowest. Further analysis suggested that this pattern may be partially explained by the semantic distance of the prompts, which followed the same pattern (i.e., professionals > AI chatbot > novices). These findings suggest that, although AI demonstrates impressive creative abilities, the worth of human creativity has not been diminished in the domain of AI-assisted outputs, which supports Guilford's view on the enduring value of human creativity.} }

Materials and Methods: One hundred SoMe posts from the top 3 journals in urology X (formerly Twitter) profiles were collected from August 2022 to October 2023. A freeware generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) tool was developed to autogenerate SoMe posts, which included title summarization, key findings, pertinent emojis, hashtags, and digital object identifier links to the article. Three physicians independently evaluated GPT-generated posts for achieving tetrafecta of accuracy and appropriateness criteria. Fifteen scenarios were created from 5 randomly selected posts from each journal. Each scenario contained both the original and the GPT-generated post for the same article. Five questions were formulated to investigate the posts' likability, shareability, engagement, understandability, and comprehensiveness. The paired posts were then randomized and presented to blinded academic authors and general public through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) responders for preference evaluation. Results: Median time for post autogeneration was 10.2 seconds (interquartile range 8.5-12.5). Of the 150 rated GPT-generated posts, 115 (76.6\%) met the correctness tetrafecta: 144 (96\%) accurately summarized the title, 147 (98\%) accurately presented the articles' main findings, 131 (87.3\%) appropriately used emojis, and 138 (92\%) appropriately used hashtags. A total of 258 academic urologists and 493 AMT responders answered the surveys, wherein the GPT-generated posts consistently outperformed the original journals' posts for both academicians and AMT responders (P < .05).

However, existing research primarily focuses on generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a better comprehension of the poem's connotations and its key components. Concurrently, the Tang poetry videos generated can significantly contribute to the reduction of cognitive load and the enhancement of understanding during the learning process. Our research showcases the potential of generative AI in the education field, specifically in the domain of multimodal teaching resources.} }

The generator component of the model takes noise vectors and conditional variables as inputs. Subsequently, a Transformer module is incorporated, where the multi-head self-attention mechanism enables the model to establish complex relationships among different data points. This is further refined through linear transformations and activation functions to enhance feature representations. Ultimately, the self-attention mechanism captures the long-range dependencies within images, facilitating the generation of high-quality images that meet specific conditions. The model's performance is assessed, and the findings show that the accuracy of the proposed model reaches 95.69\%, exceeding the baseline algorithm Generative Adversarial Network by more than 4\%. Additionally, the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio of the model's algorithm is 33dB, and the Structural Similarity Index is 0.83, indicating higher image generation quality and recognition accuracy. Therefore, the model proposed achieves high recognition and prediction accuracy of generated images, and higher image quality, promising significant application value in visual communication in the new media era.} }

For technologists developing generative AI for healthcare applications, we recommend a major frameshift in thinking away from the expectation that clinicians will ``supervise'' generative AI. Rather, these organizations and individuals should hold themselves and their technologies to the same set of high standards expected of the clinical workforce and strive to design high-performing, well-studied tools that improve care and foster the therapeutic relationship, not simply those that improve efficiency or market share.

However, the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within AIoT ecosystems remains largely unexplored. Current research predominantly addresses conventional AIoT frameworks, overlooking the innovative potential of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, Diffusion Models, Transformers, and hybrid architectures, to significantly enhance situational awareness, system optimization, operational robustness, real-time responsiveness, and adaptive decision-making in complex urban environments. AIoT systems continue to face persistent challenges, including data scarcity, poor data quality, limited adaptability, imbalanced datasets, and inadequate contextawareness. This study addresses these gaps by systematically exploring how GenAI can enhance AIoT functionalities across key domains-namely cognitive augmentation, resource efficiency, network traffic, cybersecurity, and anomaly detection-while examining their synergistic potential to improve system-level environmental performance across two interconnected layers in sustainable smart cities. At the operational layer, key findings reveal that integrating GenAI with AIoT systems enhances urban efficiency, adaptability, autonomy, robustness, and resilience by conserving resources, optimizing network traffic flows, securing infrastructures, and detecting anomalies before they escalate. Specifically, the fusion of generative intelligence with federated learning promotes sustainable, energy-efficient AIoT deployments by reducing data transmission, thereby lowering communication overhead and safeguarding user privacy. In networked environments, generative models improve synthetic traffic realism and communication efficiency. They also strengthen cybersecurity through enhanced intrusion prevention and threat detection. Additionally, they enable early identification and mitigation of anomalies, boosting operational efficiency and system robustness. These improvements stabilize sustainable smart city system functioning and prevent disruptive failures. At the environmental layer, as key findings indicate, these operational gains cascade into indirect but tangible ecological benefits, while generative models advance the core pillars of AIoT by enabling proactive, autonomous, context-aware, and self-adaptive systems that further enhance the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities. Thus, while the five domains primarily underpin the operational backbone of urban systems, their cascading effects extend to ecological outcomes. The proposed conceptual framework, distilled from key findings, integrates GenAI and AIoT and highlights both domain-specific advancements and their synergistic interactions. This framework holds significant potential to drive sustainable smart city development by fostering AIoT ecosystems that are more intelligent, resource-efficient, adaptive, secure, robust, and autonomous through the strategic application of generative intelligence. The insights gained from this study provide policymakers, urban planners, system designers, and technology developers with practical guidance to harness GAIoT for enhancing smart city resilience, sustainability, and operational intelligence.} }

While he did not foresee the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), its rapid acceleration raises important issues for his notion of digital writing as a pharmakon.

We argue that Malabou's view of neuroplasticity in human and artificial brains, and her critique of techno-narcissism in the control over technology, add an important dimension to Stiegler's political critique of education.

On the one hand, these tools can automate certain aspects of teaching, personalize educational materials, and improve learning efficiency. However, concerns are emerging regarding the impact of AI on the quality of education, the mental health of students, and fundamental academic values. This article reviews the scientific literature on the applications of artificial intelligence in education, with a special emphasis on its impact on student mental health. Based on an analysis of 120 scientific articles, the study automatically extracted data on AI implementation's potential opportunities and threats. A novel aspect of this work is identifying factors that can be considered both opportunities and threats depending on context. In addition, a frequency analysis of keywords and phrases uncovered many opportunities and challenges. All identified aspects are characterized in the article. The article also highlights key barriers to using large language models (LLMs) for detecting student mental health issues, such as underestimating suicide risk, difficulties with interpreting subtle language, biases in training data, lack of cultural sensitivity, and unresolved ethical concerns. These challenges illustrate why generative AI is not yet reliable for supporting student mental health, especially in high-risk situations. One of the key conclusions is that the use of generative AI to support student mental health is seldom addressed in existing review articles, likely due to the current unreliability of this technology.} }

This paper considers the problem of improving editorial and publishing processes, namely self-publishing, when designing book covers using machine learning and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) methods. When choosing a book, readers often have certain expectations regarding the design of the publication, including the color of the cover. These expectations can be called color preferences, and they can depend on the genre of the book, its target audience, and even personal associations. Cultural context can also influence color choice, as certain colors can symbolize different emotions or moods in different cultures. Cluster analysis of book cover images of the same genre allows us to identify color preferences inherent in the genre, which is proposed to be used when designing new covers. The capabilities of generative services for creating and improving cover designs are also investigated. An improved flow chart for using GAI in creating book covers in the process of self-publishing is proposed, which includes new stages, namely exploring, conditioning, and evolving. At these stages, the designer creates prompts for GAI and examines how they and GAI's issuances correspond to the task. Conditioning allows for even more precise adjustment of prompts to features of each book, and the evolving stage also includes post-processing of results already received from GAI. Post-processing, in turn, can be performed both in generative services and by a designer. The experiment allowed us to use the machine-learning method to determine which colors are most often found in book cover layouts of one of the genres and to check whether these colors correspond to harmonious color palettes. In accordance with the proposed scheme of the design process using generative artificial intelligence, versions of book cover layouts of a given genre were obtained.} }

This paper summarizes current research on the use of generative AI in psychology and its impact on the theory and practice of psychological science. One of the primary applications of generative AI is in psychodiagnostics, where it can be used to automate the creation of diagnostic tools and interpret test results, analyze large volumes of data, and provide more accurate diagnostic conclusions. This significantly reduces the workload on psychologists while simultaneously increasing the efficiency of diagnostic processes. In the field of psychotherapy, generative AI can be used to create individualized therapeutic programs that provide continuous support to users, which is particularly important when access to qualified specialists is limited. Another important aspect is the use of generative AI in psychological research: AI can help in creating behavior models, predicting mental disorders, developing new research methodologies, reducing routine administrative burdens, and more. While generative AI revolutionizes the work of psychologists, it simultaneously creates complex issues related to ethics, confidentiality, accuracy of diagnostic and therapeutic methods, and more. To ensure that generative AI is effective and ethical, clear standards and regulatory frameworks must be developed for its use. Therefore, the authors propose recommendations for the implementation of AI in psychological practice, emphasizing the need to develop specific guidelines to address these issues. The role of psychologists in ensuring the ethical use of AI, the necessity of continuous monitoring, and the assessment of its impact on users are also discussed. Overall, generative AI holds great potential for psychological research and practice, but its implementation requires careful planning and consideration of ethical aspects to ensure safety and effectiveness.} }

Drawing upon Construal Level Theory (CLT), Goal Pursuit Theory, and Nudging Theory, we examine whether narrow (vs. broad) GenAI nudges enhance consumers' sense of empowerment by increasing goal desirability. Three mixed-method studies (one qualitative and two experimental) reveal that narrow GenAI nudges significantly heighten goal desirability, leading to greater consumer empowerment and key behavioral outcomes, including satisfaction, repurchase intentions, and advocacy (net promoter score).

Objectives To assess trainee experience with an ambient artificial intelligence scribe using measures of usability, acceptability, and documentation burden. Methods This prospective observational study enrolled 47 trainees in a 2-month pilot. Pre/postsurveys were conducted with the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX, raw unweighted form, pre/post, for cognitive load during the documentation), the System Usability Scale (post; general usability), the Net Promoter Score (post; acceptability), and the AMIA TrendBurden Survey (pre/post; documentation burden). Electronic health record utilization metrics were obtained from Epic Signal for both the pilot period and a 6-month baseline. Results In total, 43/47 (91.5\%) of participants adopted the intervention in practice. NASA-TLX scores improved from 56.3 to 43.3 (p < 0.001), and multiple items on the TrendBurden survey improved with high measures of acceptability. No significant difference in time spent on notes activity per note written was observed, with a median increase of 0.4 minutes ( p = 0.568).

Although repeatedly questioned by many critics per se value-neutral generative AI stands a good chance of becoming an important tool for presenting chemical information throughout all strata of society. Additionally, it can support the spread of science-based opinions on chemistry to the public and help popularize science in general as well. AI allows virtually every scientist to become a major player in science communication. This could lead to a containment of chemophobia. However, the use of AI as a communication tool requires continuous education, personal development and training of those who use it, in this case chemists and scientists in general. They will play a crucial role as arbiters of the appropriateness, adequacy and factual accuracy of the content generated by generative AI. The democratization of communication made possible by generative AI entails the need to adapt the dialogue to the communication preferences, demography and education of the interlocutors. Thus, generative AI empowers both those who enter the prompts and those who receive the subsequent results. Most scientists do not realize it, but generative AI puts the public, not scientists, at the center of communication. It is important to recognize this and use generative AI to target communication, education, and overall community development. The clash of narratives that may be a natural consequence of the growing number of generative AI users and the increasing amount of content being created may, perhaps unexpectedly for many, lead to the opposite result - a new Enlightenment. Either way, chemists would do well to be there; for their ability to understand the laws of matter, the beginning and end of things; for the dual nature of chemistry as an art and a science.} }

Then, through three rounds of empirical research-semi-structured interviews (N = 35), expert surveys (N = 36), and designer surveys (N = 109)-the specific content of the framework was repeatedly evaluated and refined. Finally, the framework was applied to design practice (N = 43) to explore its impact on design outcomes. The study concluded that design competence in the era of generative AI consists of four core aspects: design aesthetics competence, design thinking competence, design practice competence, and design resilience competence.} }

One of the key issues concerns security of this cyberspace that is controlled by machines, so the system can run properly. A particular situation, given the heterogeneous and special nature of the environment, is the case of IoT. The limited resources of some components in such a network and the distributed nature of the topology make these types of environments vulnerable to many different attacks and information leakages. The capability of Generative Artificial Intelligence to generate contents and to autonomously learn and predict situations can be very useful for making decisions automatically and instantly, significantly enhancing the security of IoT systems.

Several studies assessed its efficacy in improving medical studies learning, and others assessed medical students' knowledge and attitudes about generative AI. So, we aim to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of generative AI among medical students in Egypt. Methods In 2024, a cross-sectional study using a semi-structured questionnaire was performed, targeting 423 students as a convenient sample from 10 selected Egyptian universities by simple random sampling. The questionnaire was distributed via online platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, X, Telegram, and Messenger. Data about sociodemographic characteristics, students' general knowledge about generative AI and its limitations, and their attitudes and practices, respectively, were collected. Results About 23 (61.5\%) of the studied students had satisfactory knowledge about generative AI and (44.7\%) had a positive attitude. Males demonstrated significantly higher knowledge than females (69.3\% vs. 55\%, P-value = 0.003). Knowledge level also differs significantly by university (P-value < 0.001), with Suez-Canal and 6th October university students achieving the highest satisfactory scores. Key significant predictors that affect knowledge level include gender, university and study phase according to binary logistic regression results. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between satisfactory knowledge and Practice level (r = 0.303, P < 0.001). Finally, most students use generative AI to check Grammar and prepare their homework or assignments. Conclusion and recommendations There is moderate knowledge and positive attitude about AI that were reflected in medical students' practice. However, knowledge about AI influenced by gender, university and study phase. Importantly, better knowledge significantly correlates with greater generative AI practice. Offering specialized courses or faculty modules about AI enhance awareness among Egyptian medical students. Such initiatives will enable them to gain knowledge and apply it effectively and wisely.} }

We address this gap by investigating the potentials and concerns that Danish journalists attribute to the impact of artificial intelligence on journalism. Journalists largely acknowledge its potential to streamline news production. While they also express broader concerns about the trustworthiness of journalism and the risk of job displacement, their more immediate worry lies in the impact of artificial intelligence on job meaningfulness and professional identity. These findings reveal a differentiated perspective on the profession-wide and individual impacts of artificial intelligence on journalism. Furthermore, journalists emphasise their human qualities and skills such as nuanced judgement, empathy, and creativity as beyond artificial intelligence's capabilities. This indicates that artificial intelligence prompts journalists to reshape their expertise to prioritise the human touch in journalism, suggesting a broadened view of the journalistic profession.

Generative AI (GAI) applications in particular offer interesting possibilities here, for example, to generate texts, images or computer codes with the help of algorithms and to integrate these as useful supports in various AM processes. This paper examines the opportunities that GAI offers specifically for additive manufacturing. There are currently relatively few publications that deal with the topic of GAI in AM. Much of the information has only been published in preprints. There, the focus has been on algorithms for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). This summarised presentation of the state of the art of GAI in AM is new and the link to specific use cases is this first comprehensive case study on GAI in AM processes. Building on this, three specific use cases are then developed in which generative AI tools are used to optimise AM processes. Finally, a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis is carried out on the general possibilities of GAI, which forms the basis for an in-depth discussion on the sensible use of GAI tools in AM. The key findings of this work are that GAI can be integrated into AM processes as a useful support, making these processes faster and more creative, as well as to make the process information digitally recordable and usable. This current and future potential, as well as the technical implementation of GAI into AM, is also presented and explained visually. It is also shown where the use of generative AI tools can be useful and where current or future potential risks may arise.} }

In this context, prompt engineering has emerged as a critical skill for optimizing AI-generated outputs. However, research on how higher education students interact with these technologies remains limited, particularly in non-English-speaking contexts. This exploratory study examines how 102 higher education students in Chile formulated prompts in Spanish and how their techniques influenced the responses generated by ChatGPT (free version 3.5). A quantitative analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between prompt techniques and response quality. Two emergent prompt engineering strategies were identified: the Guide Contextualization Strategy and the Specific Purpose Strategy. The Guide Contextualization Strategy focused on providing explicit contextual information to guide ChatGPT's responses, aligning with few-shot prompting, while the Specific Purpose Strategy emphasized defining the request's purpose, aligning with structured objective formulation strategies. The regression analysis indicated that the Guide Contextualization Strategy had a greater impact on response quality, reinforcing the importance of contextual information in effective interactions with large language models. As an exploratory study, these findings provide preliminary evidence on prompt engineering strategies in Spanish, a relatively unexplored area in artificial intelligence education research. Based on these results, a methodological framework is proposed, encompassing four key dimensions: grammatical skills; prompt strategies; response from the large language model; and evaluation of response quality. This framework lays the groundwork for future artificial intelligence digital literacy interventions, fostering critical and effective engagement with generative artificial intelligence while also highlighting the need for further research to validate and expand these initial insights.} }

For discriminative tasks, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are still major AI techniques. Vision transformers (ViT), inspired by the transformer architecture in natural language processing, has emerged as useful techniques for discriminating retinal images. ViT can attain excellent results when pretrained at sufficient scale and transferred to specific tasks with fewer images, compared to conventional CNN. Many studies found better performance of ViT, compared to CNN, for common tasks such as diabetic retinopathy screening on color fundus photographs (CFP) and segmentation of retinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is the main AI technique in generative AI in retinal imaging. Novel images generated by GAN can be applied for training AI models in imbalanced or inadequate datasets. Foundation models are also recent advances in retinal imaging. They are pretrained with huge datasets, such as millions of CFP and OCT images and fine-tuned for downstream tasks with much smaller datasets. A foundation model, RETFound, which was self-supervised and found to discriminate many eye and systemic diseases better than supervised models. Large language models are foundation models that may be applied for text-related tasks, like reports of retinal angiography. Whereas AI technology moves forward fast, real-world use of AI models moves slowly, making the gap between development and deployment even wider. Strong evidence showing AI models can prevent visual loss may be required to close this gap.} }

To address these challenges, we develop a universal resource-efficient generative incentive mechanism framework, in which we design resource-efficient methods for network overhead reduction, formulate appropriate incentive mechanisms for the resource allocation problem, and utilize generative diffusion models (GDMs) to find the optimal incentive mechanism solutions. Furthermore, we conduct a case study on resource-constrained mobile edge networks, employing model partitioning for efficient AI task offloading, and proposing a GDM-based Stackelberg model to motivate edge devices to contribute computing resources for mobile edge intelligence.

To examine what factors impact the continuous intention to use GenAI, this paper contemplates incorporating the technology acceptance model with self-determination theory. University students were requested to fill out questionnaire forms that were designed to gather data for the proposed model. A hybrid approach combining a linear partial least squares structural equation modeling model with compensation and a non-linear artificial neural network (ANN) model without compensation is used to investigate the effect of CI on the use of GenAI as an educational tool. The empirical results indicated that perceived usefulness and autonomy are significant predictors of the continued intention to use GenAI in the Thai context. However, the CI was unaffected by perceived ease of use. Additionally, the ANN model indicates that relatedness is the most important predictor.

The authors suggest a more balanced analysis, acknowledging that GAI's impacts will unfold dynamically over time as diverse implementations interact with human stakeholders and contextual factors. While Big Tech firms dominate GAI's supply, its demand is expected to evolve through experimentation and use cases.

These contingencies represent trade-offs arising from GAI instantiations, shaped by technological advancements, stakeholder dynamics, and contextual factors, including societal responses and regulations.

This is particularly critical in areas like healthcare, employment, criminal justice, credit scoring, and increasingly, in generative AI models (GenAI) that produce synthetic media. Such systems can lead to unfair outcomes and perpetuate existing inequalities, including generative biases that affect the representation of individuals in synthetic data. This survey study offers a succinct, comprehensive overview of fairness and bias in AI, addressing their sources, impacts, and mitigation strategies. We review sources of bias, such as data, algorithm, and human decision biases-highlighting the emergent issue of generative AI bias, where models may reproduce and amplify societal stereotypes. We assess the societal impact of biased AI systems, focusing on perpetuating inequalities and reinforcing harmful stereotypes, especially as generative AI becomes more prevalent in creating content that influences public perception. We explore various proposed mitigation strategies, discuss the ethical considerations of their implementation, and emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure effectiveness. Through a systematic literature review spanning multiple academic disciplines, we present definitions of AI bias and its different types, including a detailed look at generative AI bias. We discuss the negative impacts of AI bias on individuals and society and provide an overview of current approaches to mitigate AI bias, including data pre-processing, model selection, and post-processing. We emphasize the unique challenges presented by generative AI models and the importance of strategies specifically tailored to address these. Addressing bias in AI requires a holistic approach involving diverse and representative datasets, enhanced transparency and accountability in AI systems, and the exploration of alternative AI paradigms that prioritize fairness and ethical considerations. This survey contributes to the ongoing discussion on developing fair and unbiased AI systems by providing an overview of the sources, impacts, and mitigation strategies related to AI bias, with a particular focus on the emerging field of generative AI.} }

Thus, reducing energy loss while ensuring the filling effect becomes crucial for improving process efficiency. Owing to variations among mines, accurately calculating pipeline resistance loss remains challenging, resulting in significant inaccuracies. The rapid development of Industry 4.0 provides intelligent and data-driven optimization ideas for this challenge. This study introduces a novel pipeline resistance loss prediction framework integrating generative artificial intelligence with a TransKAN model. This study employs generative artificial intelligence to produce physically constrained augmented data, integrates the KAN network's B-spline basis functions for nonlinear feature extraction, and incorporates the Transformer architecture to capture spatio-temporal correlations in pipeline pressure sequences, enabling precise resistance loss calculation. The experimental data collected from pipeline pressure sensors provides empirical validation for the model. Compared with traditional mathematical formulas, BP neural networks, SVMs, and random forests, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance, achieving an R2 value of 0.9644, an RMSE of 0.7126, and an MAE of 0.4703.} }

Based on media naturalness theory, trust literature, and the stimulus-organism-response model, we propose and test a research model via a survey. Our results show that accuracy of response, self-learning, and natural language interaction enhance users' intention to use GCAI and trust in it, while human-like empathy influences trust but not intention. Trust fully mediates the relationship between human-like empathy and intention, and partially mediates the relationship between the other three competencies and intention.

This potential for bias has grown progressively more important in recent years as GAI has become increasingly integrated in multiple critical sectors, such as healthcare, consumer lending, and employment. While much of the study of gender bias in popular GAI systems is focused on text-based GAI such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini (formerly Bard), this article describes the results of a confirmatory experiment of gender bias in visual GAI systems. The authors argue that the potential for gender bias in visual GAI systems is potentially more troubling than bias in textual GAI because of the superior memorability of images and the capacity for emotional communication that images represent. They go on to offer four potential approaches to gender bias in visual GAI based on the roles visual GAI could play in modern society. The article concludes with a discussion of how dominant societal values could influence a choice between those four potential approaches to gender bias in visual GAI and some suggestions for further research.} }

Frank}, abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into manufacturing processes is emerging as a transformative strategy to enhance automation, optimize workflows, and foster innovation in intelligent production systems. Unlike traditional rule-based automation, generative AI leverages advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to enable autonomous decision-making, adaptive process refinement, and real-time data generation. This paradigm shift facilitates a range of advanced applications, including AI-driven product design optimization, proactive maintenance, intelligent quality control, and dynamic supply chain management. This study explores the potential of generative AI to redefine modern manufacturing by providing scalable, data-driven solutions that minimize downtime, reduce waste, and support sustainable production goals. In particular, we highlight the role of generative models in creating synthetic datasets for model training, enabling real-time defect detection, and supporting hyper-personalized production. The self-learning and pattern recognition capabilities of generative AI empower manufacturing systems to dynamically adapt to evolving operational requirements. To evaluate practical implications, three case studies are presented that demonstrate the implementation and impact of generative AI in diverse manufacturing scenarios. These cases underscore both the opportunities and challenges associated with deployment, including high computational demands, data security concerns, and integration with legacy systems. Ethical considerations such as bias mitigation and model transparency are also discussed as critical components of responsible AI adoption. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of generative AI applications in manufacturing, offering insights into how these technologies can support the next generation of intelligent, adaptive, and sustainable production systems.} }

In this paper, we consider the evolving and emerging trends of AI in order to examine its present and predict its future impacts. Many existing papers on GenAI are either too technical for most information systems researchers or lack the depth needed to appreciate the potential impacts of GenAI. We, therefore, attempt to bridge the technical and organizational communities of GenAI from a system-oriented sociotechnical perspective. Specifically, we explore the unique features of GenAI, which are rooted in the continued change from symbolism to connectionism, and the deep systemic and inherent properties of human-AI ecosystems. We retrace the evolution of AI that proceeded the level of adoption, adaption, and use found today, in order to propose future research on various impacts of GenAI in both business and society within the context of information systems research. Our efforts are intended to contribute to the creation of a well-structured research agenda in the information systems community to support innovative strategies and operations enabled by this new wave of AI.} }

Using the Unified Theory of the Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and its key behaviour intention determinant, social influence, the relationship between GenAI popularity among peers and its use intention was examined. Survey data (271 UAE university students) revealed a significant relationship between social influence and GenAI use intention, with undergraduate students being more affected by peers than graduates. This difference may be explained by higher autonomy, level of independence, and less cohesive peer networks among graduate students. The increased GenAI popularity among undergraduate students can also be attributed to some degree to the non-voluntary nature of their environment and a stronger peer influence. The study contributes to UTAUT advancement by extending the social influence construct to voluntary and non-voluntary GenAI use settings.} }
