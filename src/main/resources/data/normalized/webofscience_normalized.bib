Although ChatGPT is just one of many generative artificial intelligence technologies, its impact on teaching and learning processes has been significant. This article reflects on the advantages, disadvantages, potentials, limits, and challenges of generative artificial intelligence technologies in education to avoid the biases inherent in extremist positions. To this end, we conducted a systematic review of both the tools and the scientific production that have emerged in the six months since the appearance of ChatGPT. Generative artificial intelligence is extremely powerful and improving at an accelerated pace, but it is based on large language models with a probabilistic basis, which means that they have no capacity for reasoning or comprehension and are therefore susceptible to containing errors that need to be contrasted. On the other hand, many of the problems associated with these technologies in educational contexts already existed before their appearance, but now, due to their power, we cannot ignore them, and we must assume what our speed of response will be to analyse and incorporate these tools into our teaching practice.} }

The majority of teachers felt that generative AI would have a major or profound impact on teaching and assessment, though a sizeable minority felt it would have a little or no impact. Teaching level, experience, discipline area, region, and gender all significantly influenced perceived impact of generative AI on teaching and assessment. Higher levels of awareness of generative AI predicted higher perceived impact, pointing to the possibility of an `ignorance effect'. Thematic analysis revealed the specific curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment changes that teachers feel are needed as a result of generative AI, which centre around learning with AI, higher-order thinking, ethical values, a focus on learning processes and face-to-face relational learning. Teachers were most motivated to change their teaching and assessment practices to increase the performance expectancy of their students and themselves.

There is an urgent need to develop students' evaluative judgement - the capability to judge the quality of work of self and others - in recognition of this new reality. In this conceptual paper, we describe the intersection between evaluative judgement and generative AI with a view to articulating how assessment practices can help students learn to work productively with generative AI. We propose three foci: (1) developing evaluative judgement of generative AI outputs; (2) developing evaluative judgement of generative AI processes; and (3) generative AI assessment of student evaluative judgements. We argue for developing students' capabilities to identify and calibrate quality of work - uniquely human capabilities at a time of technological acceleration - through existing formative assessment strategies. These approaches circumvent and interrupt students' uncritical usage of generative AI. The relationship between evaluative judgement and generative AI is more than just the application of human judgement to machine outputs. We have a collective responsibility, as educators and learners, to ensure that humans do not relinquish their roles as arbiters of quality.} }

Following Freud, this lingo-technological development is conceptualized as the ``fourth narcissistic blow'' that science inflicts on humanity. We argue that this narcissistic blow has a potentially dramatic influence on perceptions of human society, interrelationships, and the self. We should, accordingly, expect dramatic changes in perceptions of the therapeutic act following the emergence of what we term the artificial third in the field of psychotherapy. The introduction of an artificial third marks a critical juncture, prompting us to ask the following important core questions that address two basic elements of critical thinking, namely, transparency and autonomy: (1) What is this new artificial presence in therapy relationships? (2) How does it reshape our perception of ourselves and our interpersonal dynamics? and (3) What remains of the irreplaceable human elements at the core of therapy?

Hence, predicting the value of alternatives is important for strategic decision making. We investigate the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in evaluating strategic alternatives using business models generated by AI (study 1) or submitted to a competition (study 2). Each study uses a sample of 60 business models and examines agreement in business model rankings made by large language models (LLMs) and those by human experts. We consider multiple LLMs, assumed LLM roles, and prompts. We find that generative AI often produces evaluations that are inconsistent and biased. However, when aggregating evaluations, AI rankings tend to resemble those of human experts. This study highlights the value of generative AI in strategic decision making by providing predictions.Managerial SummaryManagers are seeking to create value by integrating generative AI into their organizations. We show how managers can use generative AI to help evaluate strategic decisions. Generative AI's single evaluations are often inconsistent or biased. However, if managers aggregate many evaluations across LLMs, prompts, or roles, the results show that the resulting evaluations tend to resemble those of human experts. This approach allows managers to obtain insight on strategic decisions across a variety of domains with relatively low investments in time or resources, which can be combined with human inputs.} }

Generative artificial intelligence can be used before surgery for planning and decision support by extracting patient information and providing patients with information and simulation regarding the procedure. Intraoperatively, generative artificial intelligence can document data that is normally not captured as intraoperative adverse events or provide information to help decision-making. Postoperatively, GAIs can help with patient discharge and follow-up. The ability to provide real-time feedback and store it for later review is an important capability of GAIs.

Digital twins, which are in silico replications of an individual and its environment, have advanced clinical decision-making and prognostication in cardiovascular medicine. The technology enables personalized simulations of clinical scenarios, prediction of disease risk, and strategies for clinical trial augmentation. Current applications of cardiovascular digital twins have integrated multi-modal data into mechanistic and statistical models to build physiologically accurate cardiac replicas to enhance disease phenotyping, enrich diagnostic workflows, and optimize procedural planning. Digital twin technology is rapidly evolving in the setting of newly available data modalities and advances in generative artificial intelligence, enabling dynamic and comprehensive simulations unique to an individual. These twins fuse physiologic, environmental, and healthcare data into machine learning and generative models to build real-time patient predictions that can model interactions with the clinical environment to accelerate personalized patient care.

How can this `generative AI' be compared with the `real' intelligence of the human brain, when for example a human generates a whole memory in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, and then generates further prospective thoughts? Here these two types of generative intelligence, artificial in machines and real in the human brain are compared, and it is shown how when whole memories are generated by hippocampal recall in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, what the human brain computes, and how it computes it, are very different from generative AI. Key differences are the use of local associative learning rules in the hippocampal memory system, and of non-local backpropagation of error learning in AI. Indeed, it is argued that the whole operation of the human brain is performed computationally very differently to what is implemented in generative AI. Moreover, it is emphasized that the primate including human hippocampal system includes computations about spatial view and where objects and people are in scenes, whereas in rodents the emphasis is on place cells and path integration by movements between places. This comparison with generative memory and processing in the human brain has interesting implications for the further development of generative AI and for neuroscience research.} }

The ability of these systems to simulate human capabilities such as text writing and image creation is radically redefining a wide range of practices, from artistic production to education. While there is no doubt that these innovations are beneficial to our lives, the pervasiveness of these technologies should not be underestimated, and raising increasingly pressing ethical questions that require a radical resemantization of certain notions traditionally ascribed to humans alone. Among these notions, that of technological intentionality plays a central role. With regard to this notion, this paper first aims to highlight what we propose to define in terms of the intentionality gap, whereby, insofar as, currently, (1) it is increasingly difficult to assign responsibility for the actions performed by AI systems to humans, as these systems are increasingly autonomous, and (2) it is increasingly complex to reconstruct the reasoning behind the results they produce as we move away from good old fashioned AI; it is now even more difficult to trace the intentionality of AI systems back to the intentions of the developers and end users. This gap between human and technological intentionality requires a revision of the concept of intentionality; to this end, we propose here to assign preter-intentional behavior to generative AI. We use this term to highlight how AI intentionality both incorporates and transcends human intentionality; i.e., it goes beyond (preter) human intentionality while being linked to it. To show the merits of this notion, we first rule out the possibility that such preter-intentionality is merely an unintended consequence and then explore its nature by comparing it with some paradigmatic notions of technological intentionality present in the wider debate on the moral (and technological) status of AI.} }

Furthermore, the generated ratios are utilized to discover current patterns with minimized losses and errors, hence enhancing the accuracy of generative contents. Furthermore, while analysing the created patterns, we detect a significant discrepancy in lead durations, resulting in the generation of high scores for relevant information.

This gap in knowledge hinders the development of effective strategies for promoting user acceptance and optimising the design of generative artificial intelligence tools. This study extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model to investigate the factors influencing usage intention for generative artificial intelligence products. The study incorporates additional variables such as digital literacy, perceived risk and perceived trust to provide a more comprehensive framework. Using structural equation modelling to analyse survey data, the study found that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and perceived trust significantly and positively impact usage intention. In addition, digital literacy indirectly enhances usage intention through effort expectancy, while perceived risk negatively influences usage intention through reduced trust. Notably, facilitating conditions did not exhibit a significant effect on usage intention. These findings offer valuable insights for developers and researchers in the field of generative artificial intelligence, highlighting the importance of user-friendly design, performance optimisation, and trust-building measures.

The principle of transparency not only requires the operational principles and algorithms of text-based generative artificial intelligence to be interpretable, but also requires text-based generative artificial intelligence programs to fulfill basic prompting obligations to users, especially when it comes to the output content of generative artificial intelligence, which cannot guarantee true and accurate prompts.AimsThe purpose of this study is to explore the classification and frequency of prompt methods in text-based generative artificial intelligence and to propose that laws should require different prompt rules for various user categories, addressing the current gap in existing regulations.MethodsThe experiment is conducted from June 1 to 15, 2024 in the school, scientific research company, media organization hall, and railway station lounge, and Kimi program, Tongyi program, ERNIE Bot program, iFLYTEK Spark program, etc., are used as text-based generative AI programs.DiscussionThe results show that users aged 8-17 who are minors only have 6 points in their perception of the authenticity of the output content of generative artificial intelligence programs; the level of awareness of possible falsity during use reaches 4 points; the degree of user misleading is as high as 13 points.ConclusionThe study concludes that, for individuals needing special protection, such as minors, prompts should accompany every instance of content generation. For other user groups, prompts should be issued when necessary. To enhance prompt effectiveness, the program should display permanent prompts in prominent positions on the interface, using noticeable fonts and clear, well-designed wording. Research reveals that minors have insufficient perception of the authenticity of the output content of generative artificial intelligence, and the risk of misleading is significant, highlighting the importance of clear prompts for this specific group every time they generate content.} }

A total of 277 responses was collected from respondents in the USA, the UK, Canada, India, Australia, Malaysia, and Japan to test the proposed model using structural equation modeling. The findings highlight that need for uniqueness, information completeness, convenience, and deceptiveness significantly impact GenAI adoption. The results also highlight that GenAI adoption boosts firm performance. Finally, ethical leadership was found to moderate the effect of GenAI adoption on firm performance. This study enriches the GenAI, technology adoption, and behavioral reasoning theory literatures while also providing pertinent insights for firms intending to adopt GenAI.} }

The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.} }

The technologies of generative artificial intelligence have already been used by people to perform not only intellectual tasks, but also creative ones, in particular in the field of design. Therefore, their capabilities in graphic design need to be studied. One of the routine tasks of a designer is the development of corporate identity elements (a logo, font, and colour). Designers can spend a lot of time on this, choosing different style options. Therefore, delegating this routine work to generative artificial intelligence may be appropriate. With this practical need in mind, the capabilities of modern AI tools for image and logo generation were studied in the research, and the results of AI logo generation compared to the work of novice designers were analysed. As a result, conclusions were drawn about the expediency of using generative AI technology in the work of designers, in particular, for the development of corporate identity elements, and the appropriateness of studying generative artificial intelligence technology in the training of future designers. These conclusions were made on the basis of a survey of 41 experts in the field of design, information technology and artificial intelligence. Based on the findings of the survey, we can note that it was difficult for experts to distinguish between logos generated by artificial intelligence and logos created by novice designers. Logos developed by novice designers (5) were recognized as the most attractive among the 45 logos presented in the survey. Images generated in some AI tools (Tailor Brands, Hatchful) are considered attractive by design, information technology and artificial intelligence professionals. Therefore, they can be used to create corporate identity elements. Thus, the vast majority of experts agreed that artificial intelligence tools for generating images and logos should be used in the process of creating corporate identity elements.

We find that after the emergence of ChatGPT, the increase in the productivity of male researchers is 6.4\\% higher than that of female researchers, implying a widening of the productivity gap between them. We then conduct a survey about researchers' use of ChatGPT and find that male researchers use generative AI more frequently and experience higher efficiency improvement from its use than female researchers.

It will be argued that generative artificial intelligence presents risks of diminishing cognitive activity among students, as it is likely to substitute-rather than complement-the cognitive subject. It will also be argued that there are ways to leverage generative artificial intelligence so that learners are not passive but rather active cognitive subjects. Three cases will be presented, with empirical support, to show how this leveraging is possible: the production of feedback, assistive technologies, and gamification. In these cases, generative artificial intelligence is a complementary cognitive artifact rather than a substitutive one. To achieve this goal, the paper presents the framework of the extended mind thesis as a conducive scenario for analyzing the relationship between generative artificial intelligence and learning contexts, and it analyzes specific cases of science education. An analysis of the types of cognitive artifacts will also be conducted to examine how generative artificial intelligence intervenes in learning in both substitute and complementary ways.} }

The educational activities of students are currently undergoing significant chang-es due to the active integration of generative artificial intelligence into the learning process. The academic community is concerned that these technologies may not only diminish students' cognitive abilities but also undermine their role as active participants in educational activities. Consequently, it is important to develop a model of interaction between students and generative artificial intelligence that supports the preservation and enhancement of their agency. This approach will enable the management of the currently spontaneous interactions between students and neural networks, making the process purpose-ful, controlled, and focused on the personal development of students. Aim. The present study aimed to conduct a systematic analysis of scientific perspectives on student subjectivity and its interaction with generative artificial intelligence. Methodology and research methods. The aim was achieved through the following methods: analytical literature review and systems analysis. Results. It was established that the theoretical basis for developing a model of developmental interaction between students and genera-tive artificial intelligence comprised the fundamental characteristics of interaction as an interdiscipli-nary category, alongside the qualities of the subject related to autonomy, awareness, and the ability to self-regulate and self-organise activities. Scientific novelty. The interaction of students with generative artificial intelligence is regarded not only as a means to enhance educational outcomes but, above all, as an opportunity to develop the student's personal qualities. Practical significance. The materials presented in this article may be utilised by practitioners in the fields of pedagogy and educational psychology to de-velop programmes for the psychological and pedagogical support of students. Furthermore, a theoretical review and systematic analysis of the scientific literature on the concepts of interaction and subjectivity can be beneficial for conducting psychological research and teaching psychology courses.} }

Employing a stratified cluster sampling approach, questionnaire data were collected from 311 undergraduates across two universities in Zhejiang Province. The findings reveal that students' perceived teachers' transformational leadership not only directly and positively influences their employability but also exerts indirect effects through three distinct pathways: the single mediating role of problem-based learning, the single mediating role of self-efficacy, and the chain mediating role of problem-based learning and self-efficacy. Furthermore, a moderated chain mediation model demonstrates that higher levels of generative artificial intelligence usage among students strengthen the chain mediating effect of problem-based learning and self-efficacy in the relationship between perceived teachers' transformational leadership and employability. These results elucidate the intrinsic mechanism by which teachers' transformational leadership impacts college students' employability empowered by generative artificial intelligence and extend the application of Social Cognitive Career Theory and Distributed Cognition Theory within the domain of employability research.} }

To address these challenges, we propose the GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference. GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in the IIoV.

To overcome the limitations, this research proposes a Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model to generate concise summaries. During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique. Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy. Furthermore, the experimental outcomes show that the Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model surpasses the conventional text summarization techniques concerning Bilingual Evaluation Understudy of 0.71 and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering of 0.73, which shows that the proposed model generates a meaningful summary from the given text.} }

The GAN accurately reproduces real patches' species composition and plant species' affinity to different soil types, and the VAE also reaches a high level of accuracy, above 99\\%. Using the artificially generated patches, we found that high-order interactions tend to suppress the positive effects of low-order interactions.

In contrast to many existing artificial intelligence models, generative pretrained transformer models can perform with very limited training data. Generative pretrained transformer 3 (GPT-3) is one of the latest releases in this pipeline, demonstrating human-like logical and intellectual responses to prompts. Some examples include writing essays, answering complex questions, matching pronouns to their nouns, and conducting sentiment analyses. However, questions remain with regard to its implementation in health care, specifically in terms of operationalization and its use in clinical practice and research. In this viewpoint paper, we briefly introduce GPT-3 and its capabilities and outline considerations for its implementation and operationalization in clinical practice through a use case. The implementation considerations include (1) processing needs and information systems infrastructure, (2) operating costs, (3) model biases, and (4) evaluation metrics. In addition, we outline the following three major operational factors that drive the adoption of GPT-3 in the US health care system: (1) ensuring Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance, (2) building trust with health care providers, and (3) establishing broader access to the GPT-3 tools. This viewpoint can inform health care practitioners, developers, clinicians, and decision makers toward understanding the use of the powerful artificial intelligence tools integrated into hospital systems and health care.} }

The modern Russian labor market is characterized by low unemployment, staff shortages, and intersectoral imbalances. An urgent scientific task is to model scenarios for the development of the labor market in the context of sectors, taking into account the influence of generative artificial intelligence. The aim of the work is to assess the potential impact of the mass use of generative artificial intelligence on the labor market, due to changes in labor efficiency in some professions and industries, based on the analysis of statistical and expert data and economic and mathematical modeling of possible scenarios for the development of the labor market. Economic sectors were divided into three groups depending on the rate of change in personnel needs, based on the analysis of the Beveridge curve, which shows the dependence of the level of needs on the unemployment rate. Using existing statistical data and expert assessments, we determine the degree of influence of generative artificial intelligence on labor efficiency in various industries. We put forward an approach that helps to obtain estimates of possible scenarios for the development of sectoral labor markets for the period up to 2030, based on official forecasts of ministries (Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Labor of the Russian Federation) for the period up to 2026, their extrapolation, and superimposition of the impact of mass use of generative artificial intelligence (as a disturbing effect). The results obtained suggest that the severity of staff shortage issue in general can be partially reduced by using generative artificial intelligence; thus, we identified industries in which (a) it is possible to address the problem of staff shortage at the current level of needs, and (b) staff shortage will persist. Modeling the migration of professions and personnel between industries seems promising, because the expected effect of mass technology adoption will not only change the balance of labor resources, but also lead to the need to re-profile some of the personnel.} }

The study is centered around the following questions: Does the use of generative artificial intelligence in an open learning environment enhance college students' critical thinking skills (what)? What is the mechanism by which the use of generative artificial intelligence affects college students' critical thinking (how)? From the perspective of self-regulated learning theory and learning motivation theory, what are the reasons for the impact of generative artificial intelligence on college students' critical thinking skills (why)? To this end, the study employs questionnaires and interviews to collect data. The questionnaire data are subjected to descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, multiple stepwise regression analysis, and mediation effect analysis. Based on the analysis of interview materials and survey questionnaire data, the study reveals the impacts and mechanisms of college students' use of generative artificial intelligence tools on their critical thinking skills. The findings of the study are as follows. First, the frequency of artificial intelligence use is unrelated to critical thinking skills, but using it for reflective thinking helps to develop critical thinking skills. Second, students with strong self-regulated learning skills are more likely to use generative artificial intelligence for reflective thinking and achieve better development in critical thinking skills. Third, students with strong intrinsic learning motivation are more likely to use generative artificial intelligence for reflective thinking and achieve better development in critical thinking skills. Consequently, the article analyzes the reasons from the perspectives of self-regulated learning theory and learning motivation theory and offers insights into how to properly use generative artificial intelligence to promote the development of critical thinking skills from the perspectives of higher education institutions, college teachers, and college students.} }

Following Gl \\& auml;ser-Zikuda's model of Self-Reflecting Methods of Learning Research, this study systematically engages in reflective observation to examine how the use of GenAI in theology classrooms has influenced personal theological thinking, pedagogical practices, and ethical considerations. It documents experiences using common generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Canva, Meta AI, Deep AI, and Gencraft in theology classes. The principles of virtue ethics and Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) offer a critical framework for ethical, pedagogical, and theological engagement. The findings contribute to the emerging interdisciplinary discourse on AI ethics and theology, and religious pedagogy in the digital age.} }

It examines how effectively new generative AI-based chatbots can handle customer emotions and explores their impact on determining the point at which a customer-machine interaction should be transferred to a human agent to prevent customer disengagement, referred to as the Switch Point (SP). Design/methodology/approach-To evaluate the capabilities of new generative AI-based chatbots in managing emotions, ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini and Copilot are tested using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire Short-Form (TEIQue-SF). A reference framework is developed to illustrate the shift in the Switch Point (SP). Findings-Using the four-intelligence framework (mechanical, analytical, intuitive and empathetic), this study demonstrates that, despite advancements in AI's ability to address emotions in customer service, even the most advanced chatbots-such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot-still fall short of replicating the empathetic capabilities of human intelligence (HI). The concept of artificial emotional awareness (AEA) is introduced to characterize the intuitive intelligence of new generative AI chatbots in understanding customer emotions and triggering the SP. A complementary rather than replacement perspective of HI and AI is proposed, highlighting the impact of generative AI on the SP. Research limitations/implications-This study is exploratory in nature and requires further theoretical development and empirical validation. Practical implications-The study has only an exploratory character with respect to the possible real impact of the introduction of the new generative AI-based chatbots on collaborative approaches to the integration of humans and technology in Society 5.0.

Personalized learning has been conceptualized for a long time, but it has only recently become realistic and truly achievable. In this paper, we propose an affordable and sustainable approach toward personalizing learning materials as part of the complete educational process. We have created a tool within a pre-existing learning management system at a software engineering college that automatically generates learning materials based on the learning outcomes provided by the professor for a particular class. The learning materials were composed in three distinct styles, the initial one being the traditional professor style and the other two variations adopting a pop-culture influence, namely Batman and Wednesday Addams. Each lesson, besides being delivered in three different formats, contained automatically generated multiple-choice questions that students could use to check their progress. This paper contains complete instructions for developing such a tool with the help of large language models using OpenAI's API and an analysis of the preliminary experiment of its usage performed with the help of 20 college students studying software engineering at a European university. Participation in the study was optional and on voluntary basis. Each student's tool usage was quantified, and two questionnaires were conducted: one immediately after subject completion and another 6 months later to assess both immediate and long-term effects, perceptions, and preferences. The results indicate that students found the multiple variants of the learning materials really engaging. While predominantly utilizing the traditional variant of the learning materials, they found this approach inspiring, would recommend it to other students, and would like to see it more in classes. The most popular feature were the automatically generated quiz-style tests that they used to assess their understanding. Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of various versions of learning materials leads to an increase in students' study time, especially for students who have not mastered the topic otherwise. The study's small sample size of 20 students restricts its ability to generalize its findings, but its results provide useful early insights and lay the groundwork for future research on AI-supported educational strategies.} }

Generative AI models mark a significant shift from the previously prevailing paradigm through their ability to generate seemingly new realistic data and analyse and integrate a vast amount of unstructured content from different data formats. This potential extends beyond reshaping conventional practices, like risk assessment, diagnostic support, and treatment and rehabilitation plans, to creating new opportunities in previously underexplored areas, such as training and education. This paper examines the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence on AI applications in forensic psychiatry and criminal justice. First, it introduces generative AI and its prevalent models. Following this, it reviews the current applications of discriminative AI in forensic psychiatry. Subsequently, it presents a thorough exploration of the potential of generative AI to transform established practices and introduce novel applications through multimodal generative models, data generation and data augmentation. Finally, it provides a comprehensive overview of ethical and legal issues associated with deploying generative AI models, focusing on their impact on individuals as well as their broader societal implications. In conclusion, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse concerning the dynamic challenges of generative AI applications in forensic contexts, highlighting potential opportunities, risks, and challenges. It advocates for interdisciplinary collaboration and emphasises the necessity for thorough, responsible evaluations of generative AI models before widespread adoption into domains where decisions with substantial life-altering consequences are routinely made.} }

These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this article aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.} }

For our analysis, we employ a multiple-case design and adopt a critical realist perspective to identify generative mechanisms of AI implementation. Overall, we find five interdependent mechanisms: experimentation; knowledge building and integration; data; anxiety; and inspiration. Using causal loop diagramming, we flesh out the socio-technical dynamics of these mechanisms and explore the organizational requirements of implementing AI.

Synthetic ethnography is not simply a qualitative research methodology applied to the study of the social and cultural contexts developing around generative artificial intelligence, but also strives to envision practical and experimental ways to repurpose these models as research tools in their own right. After briefly introducing generative models and revisiting the trajectory of digital ethnographic research, we discuss three case studies for which the authors have developed experimental field devices to study different aspects of generative artificial intelligence ethnographically. In the conclusion, we derive a broader methodological proposal from these case studies, arguing that synthetic ethnography facilitates insights into how the algorithmic processes, training datasets and latent spaces behind these systems modulate bias, reconfigure agency, and challenge epistemological categories.} }

This critical synthesis compares artificial expertise and human expertise and examines ways in which generative chatbots can support cognition using an expert thinking framework. Findings indicate that generative chatbots may support experts' cognition as a collaborator or to offload lower level tasks. Moreover, generative chatbots are a promising training tool in developing future experts in part because they can provide learning models and practice opportunities. The use of generative chatbots to offload lower level tasks, however, may harm expert development by disrupting knowledge communities. Finally, a lack of domain knowledge in nonexpert users may limit the effectiveness of generative chatbots in supporting higher level cognition and agency. Overall, existing research suggests that the potential for generative chatbots to support users' cognition depends on a user's level of expertise.} }

However, there are still areas in which GAI produces undesirable or unintended results due to being ``uncertain''. Before wider use of AI-generated content, it is important to identify concepts where GAI is uncertain to ensure the usage thereof is ethical and to direct efforts for improvement. This study proposes a general pipeline to automatically quantify uncertainty within GAI. To measure uncertainty, the textual prompt to a text-to-image model is compared to captions supplied by four image-to-text models (GIT, BLIP, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP). Its evaluation is based on machine translation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and SPICE) and word embedding's cosine similarity (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, DistilRoBERTa, MiniLM-6, and MiniLM-12). The generative AI models performed consistently across the metrics; however, the vector space models yielded the highest average similarity, close to 80\\%, which suggests more ideal and ``certain'' results. Suggested future work includes identifying metrics that best align with a human baseline to ensure quality and consideration for more GAI models. The work within can be used to automatically identify concepts in which GAI is ``uncertain'' to drive research aimed at increasing confidence in these areas.} }

Data from previously published articles and news items were reviewed in order to obtain information. We used PubMed and Google Scholar as our search engines, and keywords (pharmacovigilance, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drug safety, and patient safety) were used. In toto, we reviewed 109 articles published till 31st January 2024, and the obtained information was interpreted, compiled, evaluated, and conclusions were reached. Generative AI has transformative potential in pharmacovigilance, showcasing benefits, such as enhanced adverse event detection, data-driven risk prediction, and optimized drug development. By making it easier to process and analyze big datasets, generative artificial intelligence has applications across a variety of disease states. Machine learning and automation in this field can streamline pharmacovigilance procedures and provide a more efficient way to assess safety-related data. Nevertheless, more investigation is required to determine how this optimization affects the caliber of safety analyses.

A high-resolution surface morphology image generation system has been developed by optimising conditional generative adversarial networks. The developed virtual surface matches experimental cases well with an Frechet inception distance score of 174, in the range of accurate matching. Microstructural analysis with parts fabricated with artificial intelligence guidance exhibited less textured microstructural behaviour on the surface which reduces the anisotropy in the columnar structure.

Although there has been qualitative research on generative artificial intelligence in other fields, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers; this study seeks to report on the topic. Objective: This study aimed to describe the experiences and perceptions of generative artificial intelligence among Chinese nurse researchers, as well as provide a reference for the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research in the future. Methods: Semistructured interviews were used to collect data in this qualitative study. Researchers mainly conducted interviews on the cognition, experience, and future expectations of nurse researchers regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence. Twenty-seven nurse researchers were included in the study. Through purposive sampling and snowball sampling, there were 7 nursing faculty researchers, 10 nursing graduate students, and 10 clinical nurse researchers. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: Five themes and 12 subthemes were categorized from 27 original interview documents as follows: (1) diverse reflections on human-machine symbiosis, which includes the interplay between substitution and assistance, researchers shaping the potential of generative artificial intelligence, and acceptance of generative artificial intelligence with alacrity; (2) multiple factors of the usage experience, including individual characteristics and various usage scenarios; (3) research paradigm reshaping in the infancy stage, which involves full-process groundbreaking assistive tools and emergence of new research paths; (4) application risks of generative artificial intelligence, including intrinsic limitations of generative artificial intelligence and academic integrity and medical ethics; and (5) the co-improvement of technology and literacy, which concerns reinforcement needs for generative artificial intelligence literacy, development of nursing research generative artificial intelligence and urgent need for artificial intelligence-generated content detection tools. In this context, the first 4 themes form the rocket of the human-machine symbiosis journey. Only when humans fully leverage the advantages of machines (generative artificial intelligence) and overcome their shortcomings can this human-machine symbiosis journey reach the correct future direction (fifth theme). Conclusions: This study explored the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers interacting with generative artificial intelligence, which was a ``symbiotic journey'' full of twists and turns, and provides a reference and basis for achieving harmonious coexistence between nurse researchers and generative artificial intelligence in the future.

With this new method of producing data synthetically, the data economy is not only shifting from ``data collection'' to ``data generation.'' Synthetic data is also being employed to address some of the most pressing ethical concerns around artificial intelligence. It thereby comes with the sociotechnical imaginary that social problems can be cut out of artificial intelligence, separating training data from real persons. In response to this technical solutionism, this commentary aims to initiate a critical debate about synthetic data that goes beyond misuse scenarios such as the use of generative adversarial networks to create deep fakes or dark patterns. Instead, on a more general level, we seek to complicate the idea of ``solving,'' i.e., ``closing'' and thus ``silencing'' the ethico-political debates for which synthetic data is supposed to be a solution by showing how synthetic data itself is political. Drawing on the complex connections between recent uses of synthetic data and public debates about artificial intelligence, we therefore propose to consider and analyze synthetic data not only as a technical device but as a discursive one as well. To this end, we shed light on their relationship to three pillars that we see associated with them (a) algorithmic bias, (b) privacy, (c) platform economy.} }

Despite growing research interest in sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship, the role of technological enablers, particularly artificial intelligence, in shaping entrepreneurial intentions has been underexplored. To achieve this objective, an advanced approach-polynomial regression with response surface analysis-was employed to test the formulated hypotheses using data from 385 participants. The study further shows that sustainability-oriented entrepreneurial intentions improve significantly when perceived desirability and feasibility are aligned but remain unaffected by misalignment. Generative artificial intelligence adoption and perceived artificial intelligence capacities are shown to directly and indirectly enhance entrepreneurial intentions through perceived desirability and feasibility, highlighting the dual role of artificial intelligence as a practical enabler and psychological motivator. These findings contribute to the extent of entrepreneurial literature by indicating how artificial intelligence technologies foster sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship.

Using four Grade 12 courses (i.e., English, Mathematics, Financial Accounting, and Simplified Chinese), we assessed the performance of generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-4, GPT-4o, and the Trained-GPT model. Results demonstrate that the Trained-GPT achieved grading accuracy and consistency comparable to human teachers, with strong correlations observed in Mathematics (0.996) and English (0.874). While GPT-4o performed well in specific cases, its variability highlights areas for improvement. These findings underscore the potential of AI-powered teaching assistants to streamline grading, deliver timely feedback, and support scalable, high-quality online education.} }

The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by the design and optimisation of the enclosure structure for the New Robotic Telescope. Its complexity is characterised by multiple operating states that the enclosure can assume, in particular the closed state and the opening/closing state, each of which has a different structural behaviour. Using our approach, the results from each state were replicated with machine learning models and combined into a single evaluation model. This resulted in finding multiple solutions that outperformed the benchmark design.

Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve both the speed and quality of their output, while the most experienced and highest-skilled workers see small gains in speed and small declines in quality. We also find evidence that AI assistance facilitates worker learning and improves English fluency, particularly among international agents. While AI systems improve with more training data, we find that the gains from AI adoption are largest for moderately rare problems, where human agents have less baseline experience but the system still has adequate training data. Finally, we provide evidence that AI assistance improves the experience of work along several dimensions: customers are more polite and less likely to ask to speak to a manager.} }

In this paper, we cast the problem of rewriting as rewriting the rule in the generator with out-of-domain patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this problem has been investigated. To address this problem, we propose the Re-Generator framework. Specifically, our method projects out-of-domain images into the feature space of a specific layer in the generator and designs a mechanism to enable the generator to decode that feature back to the original image as possible. Besides that, we also suggest viewing multiple layers of the model as nonlinearity associative memory and design a rewriting strategy with better performance based on this. Finally, the results of the experiments on various generative models in multiple datasets show that our method can effectively use the patterns that the model has never seen before as rules for rewriting.} }

We develop a visual analytics approach for better understanding and diagnosing the training process of a DGM. To help experts understand the overall training process, we first extract a large amount of time series data that represents training dynamics (e.g., activation changes over time). A blue-noise polyline sampling scheme is then introduced to select time series samples, which can both preserve outliers and reduce visual clutter. To further investigate the root cause of a failed training process; we propose a credit assignment algorithm that indicates how other neurons contribute to the output of the neuron causing the training failure. Two case studies are conducted with machine learning experts to demonstrate how our approach helps understand and diagnose the training processes of DGMs. We also show how our approach can be directly used to analyze other types of deep models such as CNNs.} }

Existing DGM formulations are based on the assumption of a symmetric Gaussian posterior over the model latent variables. This assumption, although mathematically convenient, can be well-expected to undermine the eventually obtained representation power, as it imposes apparent expressiveness limitations. Indeed, it has been recently shown that even some moderate increase in the latent variable posterior expressiveness, obtained by introducing an additional level of dependencies upon auxiliary (Gaussian) latent variables, can result in significant performance improvements in the context of semi-supervised learning tasks. Inspired from these advances, in this paper we examine whether a more potent increase in the expressiveness and representation power of modern DGMs can be achieved by completely relaxing their typical symmetric (Gaussian) latent variable posterior assumptions: Specifically, we consider DGMs with asymmetric posteriors, formulated as restricted multivariate skew-Normal (rMSN) distributions. We derive an efficient amortized variational inference algorithm for the proposed model, and exhibit its superiority over the current state-of-the-art in several semi-supervised learning benchmarks.

At the center of the argument is the fact that the functionality of deep learning networks is established by training and cannot be explained and justified by reference to a predefined rule-based procedure.

The overarching question in this field is whether the output and behavior of generative AI exhibit human-like properties. Second, psychological research will play an essential role in assessing the impact of generative AI on humans. Key questions are about how generative AI can be used deceptively, how humans evaluate AI regarding competence or warmth, and how generative AI can be leveraged to foster knowledge-related processes in interaction with humans. Third, the process of psychological research itself is likely to change with generative AI. We discuss potential fields of application but also argue against some use cases (e. g., employing generative AI as a surrogate for participants in experiments).

These experiments used for model comparison involve modeling human learning and decision making based on both visual information and natural language, in tasks that vary in realism and complexity. This comparison of applications takes as its basis Instance-Based Learning Theory, a theory of experiential decision making from which many models have emerged and been applied to a variety of domains and applications.Results The best performing model from the ablation we performed used a generative model to both create memory representations as well as predict participant actions. The results of this comparison demonstrates the importance of generative models in both forming memories and predicting actions in decision-modeling research.Discussion In this work, we present a model that integrates generative and cognitive models, using a variety of stimuli, applications, and training methods.

Then, we introduce Anastatica (2020), a part performance, part installation built on the basis of data-driven generative live coding. Finally, we discuss the various implications of AI in art through a case study rooted in Anastatica's development and performance. Here we trace the path from algorithms to intelligence, applying both musical and computer science theory to a practical case of generating a live coding musical performance, with special focus given to aesthetic, compositional, conceptual, and phenomenological implications.} }

Our findings show that men exhibit more frequent engagement with genAI chatbots across a broader spectrum of applications. Further, men demonstrate a heightened interest in genAI chatbots as tools and in their relevance to future career prospects. Women primarily utilize genAI chatbots in text-related tasks and express greater concerns regarding critical and independent thinking. Women also exhibit a stronger need to learn how to determine when it is wise to use and how to trust genAI chatbots. Consequences are discussed for the individual, society, and HE institutions in terms of social reproduction, diversity competence, and equitable teaching practices.} }

Drawing on the entrepreneurial event model, polynomial regression, and response surface analysis, the study examines the congruence and incongruence between routine and innovative uses of generative artificial intelligence, capturing their complex interactions and joint effects. Data collected from 1,061 undergraduate students at Vietnamese universities revealed significant congruence effects, showing that alignment between high levels of routine and innovative uses enhances students' digital entrepreneurial intention, perceived desirability, and feasibility. Furthermore, the incongruence between these uses has a negative relationship with entrepreneurial outcomes. The study also confirms that perceived desirability and feasibility mediate the relationships between generative artificial intelligence use (routine and innovative) and digital entrepreneurial intention. These findings extend current understandings of how digital tools support entrepreneurship education, highlighting the importance of balancing exploitation (routine use) and exploration (innovative use). Practically, the results suggest that educators and policymakers should encourage students to simultaneously develop both routine and innovative competencies in generative artificial intelligence to nurture digital entrepreneurial aspirations effectively.} }

In this research, we demonstrate that exposure to gen-AI produced content can affect people's self-confidence at the same task through a social comparison process. Anchoring this research in the domain of creativity, we find that exposing people to creative content believed to have been created by gen-AI (vs. a human peer) increases people's self-confidence in their own relevant creative abilities. This effect emerges for jokes, stories, poetry, and visual art, and it can consequently increase people's willingness to attempt the activity-even though the greater confidence underscoring their actions might be unwarranted. We further show that these effects emerge because gen-AI is perceived as a lower social referent for creative endeavors, bolstering people's own self-perceptions. As a result, for domains in which gen-AI is perceived as an equal or greater social referent (i.e., in fact-based domains), the effects are attenuated. These findings have significant implications for understanding human-AI interactions, antecedents for creative self-confidence, and the known referents that people use for social comparison effects.} }

This article examines the first international governance and policy initiatives dedicated specifically to generative AI: the G7 Hiroshima process, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reports, and the UK AI Safety Summit. This analysis is informed by policy framing and governance literature, in particular by the work on technology governance and Responsible Innovation. Emerging governance of generative AI exhibits characteristics of polycentric governance, where multiple and overlapping centers of decision-making are in collaborative relationships. However, it is dominated by a limited number of developed countries. The governance of generative AI is mostly framed in terms of the risk management, largely neglecting issues of purpose and direction of innovation, and assigning rather limited roles to the public. We can see a ``paradox of generative AI governance'' emerging, namely, that while this technology is being widely used by the public, its governance is rather narrow. This article coins the term ``governance fix'' to capture this rather narrow and technocratic approach to governing generative AI. As an alternative, it suggests embracing the politics of polycentric governance and Responsible Innovation that highlight democratic and participatory co-shaping of technology for social benefit. In the context of the highly unequal distribution of power in generative AI characterized by a high concentration of power in a small number of large tech companies, the government has a special role in reshaping the power imbalances by enabling wide-ranging public participation in the governance of generative AI.} }

Early detection and accurate imaging are vital for managing CVD, emphasizing the significance of patient education. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), including algorithms to synthesize text, speech, images, and combinations thereof given a specific scenario or prompt, offers promising solutions for enhancing patient education. By combining vision and language models, generative AI enables personalized multimedia content generation through natural language interactions, benefiting patient education in cardiovascular imaging. Simulations, chat-based interactions, and voice-based interfaces can enhance accessibility, especially in resource-limited settings. Despite its potential benefits, implementing generative AI in resource-limited countries faces challenges like data quality, infrastructure limitations, and ethical considerations. Addressing these issues is crucial for successful adoption. Ethical challenges related to data privacy and accuracy must also be overcome to ensure better patient understanding, treatment adherence, and improved healthcare outcomes.

Drawing on recent research in artificial intelligence, critical thinking and professional practice, the article proposes a reframing model-EIPP-CT (Evidence-Informed Policy and Practice with Critical Thinking)-that places critical thinking at the heart of evidence use. Here, critical thinking is conceptualised not merely as a cognitive skill, but as a professional stance encompassing interpretive judgement, epistemic reflexivity and ethical responsibility.

Our findings reveal that, under the single AIGC strategy, focusing on investments in the AI training R\\&D sector alone can enhance the GAI smartness level more effectively than adopting the dual AIGC strategy. Conversely, under the dual AIGC strategy, firms initially tend to select GAI empowerment toward the downstream advertising sector more than the upstream R\\&D sector.

A beta-variational autoencoder (beta-VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace's equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects.

Existing literature has proposed various algorithms based on different assumptions, many of which rely on the existence of appropriate generative models. Some of these assumptions, particularly the assumption regarding the existence of generative models, may be overly stringent.

However, limited research has investigated how students perceive and accept these emerging technologies. This study addresses this gap by developing a scale to assess university students' attitudes toward generative AI tools in education.Methods A three-stage process was employed to develop and validate the Generative AI Attitude Scale. Data were collected from 664 students from various faculties during the 2022-2023 academic year. Expert evaluations were conducted to establish face and content validity. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on a subset of 400 participants, revealing a two-factor, 14-item structure that explained 78.440\\% of the variance. A subsequent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on a separate sample of 264 students to validate this structure, resulting in the removal of one item and a final 13-item scale.Results The 13-item scale demonstrated strong reliability, evidenced by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 and a test-retest reliability of 0.90. Discriminative power was confirmed through corrected item-total correlations between lower and upper percentile groups. These findings indicate that the scale effectively differentiates student attitudes toward generative AI tools in educational contexts.Discussion The newly developed Generative AI Attitude Scale offers a valid and reliable instrument for measuring university students' perspectives on integrating generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, into educational environments.

Background: Recently, GenAI-assisted teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are limited. Design: A quasi-experimental study. Methods: Based on OBE theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66) and control groups (n = 66). Results: After completing the course, the HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group before and after the course. Conclusion: GenAI-assisted teaching could help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy.

Different classical approaches that depend on existing approaches and assumptions, generative AI controls advanced deep learning (DL) approaches like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to identify designs and connections in time series data. DL has accomplished major success in optimizing performances connected with AI. In the financial area, it can be extremely utilized for the stock market predictive, trade implementation approaches, and set of optimizers. Stock market predictive is the most important use case in this field. GANs with advanced AI approaches have become more significant in recent times. However, it can be utilized in image-image-translation and other computer vision (CV) conditions. GANs could not utilized greatly for stock market prediction because of their effort to establish the proper set of hyperparameters. This study develops an integrated spotted hyena optimization algorithm with generative artificial intelligence for time series forecasting (SHOAGAI-TSF) technique. The purpose of the SHOAGAI-TSF technique is to accomplish a forecasting process for the utilization of stock price prediction. The SHOAGAI-TSF technique uses probabilistic forecasting with a conditional GAN (CGAN) approach for the prediction of stock prices. The CGAN model learns the data generation distribution and determines the probabilistic prediction from it. To boost the prediction results of the CGAN approach, the hyperparameter tuning can be performed by the use of the SHOA. The simulation result analysis of the SHOAGAI-TSF technique takes place on the stock market dataset. The experimental outcomes determine the significant solution of the SHOAGAI-TSF algorithm with other compared methods in terms of distinct metrics.} }

Their application in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) marks a pivotal advancement in the evolution from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Considering the inherent multiple-access nature of AIoT, training GDMs via federated learning and deploying them collaboratively is paramount. However, such approaches introduce considerable security risks and energy consumption challenges. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive architecture for GDMs, encompassing both training and sampling stages. This architecture, termed secure and sustainable diffusion (SS-Diff), aims to thwart trigger-based security threats, such as backdoor attacks and trojan attacks, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption in multiple-access AIoT. The SS-Diff architecture incorporates a dynamic quantization mechanism within the training phase, significantly reducing communication overhead and thereby improving both spectrum and energy efficiency. During the sampling stage, a detection-based defense strategy is employed to identify and negate trigger inputs associated with malicious attacks. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance of the SS-Diff architecture. The results demonstrate that the SS-Diff can effectively train GDMs and eliminate the impact of the attacks, compared with existing schemes.} }

The first one emanates from technological solutionism, a belief that any problem can be solved with the assistance of technology (the technosolutionist discourse), and the second one concerns the utterances generated by ChatGPT itself, which are shaped by various algorithmic, epistemic and linguistic influences (the generative discourse). In simpler terms, what ChatGPT can do to management appears to depend on ``what is said about it'' and ``what it says''. In contrast to the existing literature on ChatGPT's potential influence on organizations, this article, through its discursive approach, takes a non-normative position, to reveal the subtler influences of generative artificial intelligence, and highlight the individual and organizational responsibilities of actors interacting with these two discourses.

Methods We employed the Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3.5 (GPT) as the generative AI platform and used DocsBot for citation retrieval (June 2023). A structured prompt was devised to generate 100 questions from the AI, based on epidemiological survey data regarding sexual difficulties among cancer survivors. These questions were submitted to Bot1 (standard GPT) and Bot2 (sourced from two clinical guidelines). Results No censorship of sexual expressions or medical terms occurred. Despite the lack of reflection on guideline recommendations, `consultation' was significantly more prevalent in both bots' responses compared with pharmacological interventions, with ORs of 47.3 (p<0.001) in Bot1 and 97.2 (p<0.001) in Bot2. Discussion Generative AI can serve to provide health information on sensitive topics such as sexual health, despite the potential for policy-restricted content. Responses were biased towards non-pharmacological interventions, which is probably due to a GPT model designed with the `s prohibition policy on replying to medical topics.

Vincent}, abstract = {The growth of intelligent vehicular services, like augmented reality (AR) road simulation, underscores the need for rapid, multi-modal content generation. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models, known for their swift production of diverse artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), stand out as a prime solution. However, integrating cloud-centric GAI models into vehicular networks is fraught with challenges. Notably, to offer specialized generative edge intelligence (EI) and boost vehicular AIGC, GAI models need to tap into user data and utilize significant computation resources. Moreover, their deployment across vehicular networks is essential for proximity-based distributed inferences. Yet, edge devices are resource-limited, and data sharing can raise safety and privacy concerns. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces GAI-IoV, an EI-enabled GAI framework facilitated through the cooperation between road-side units (RSUs) and vehicles. Subsequently, we propose the workflow for collaborative fine-tuning and distributed inference. On this basis, two pivotal vehicle-centric problems are then formulated: computation and communication resource allocation for federated fine-tuning (FFT) to optimize time and energy cost, and splitting strategy of shared and local inferences to optimize inference latency and content-generation capability. To solve these optimizations, we introduce a self-adaptive global best harmony search (SGHS) algorithm for resource allocation and a backward induction method for determining inference splitting strategy. Our experiments based on the Stable Diffusion v1-4 model vouch for a superior fine-tuning and inference capabilities of GAI-IoV. Furthermore, simulations underscore its resource utilization and distributed inference efficiency in dynamic vehicular scenarios.} }

A total of 91 participants were enrolled in this study and divided into three groups: experimental group 1 (generative artificial intelligence interactive metacognitive scaffolding), experimental group 2 (video metacognitive scaffolding), and control group (text metacognitive scaffolding). The results showed that students in the generative artificial intelligence group responded with higher perceived fidelity and were significantly better than the control group with text-based metacognitive scaffolding in terms of learning effectiveness, flow, and germane cognitive load. Behavioral pattern analysis reveals that learners can effectively obtain a lot of positive help in solving tasks through positive interactions with non-player character chatbot. This framework and the findings of the study can be used as a reference for related studies in the field of game-based learning in the use of metacognitive scaffolding, contextual learning, and generative AI.

Background: The success of the nursing process is based on the accuracy of nursing diagnoses, which also determine nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. Educating nurses in the use of artificial intelligence in the nursing process can significantly reduce the time nurses spend on documentation. Design: Discussion paper. Methods: We used a case study from Train4Health in the field of preventive care to demonstrate the potential of using Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses in documenting the nursing process using generative artificial intelligence. Based on the case study, we entered a description of the patient's condition into Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) and asked questions about nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. We further synthesized these results. Results: In the process of educating nurses about the nursing process and nursing diagnosis, Generative Pretraining Transformer (ChatGPT) can present potential patient problems to nurses and guide them through the process from taking a medical history, setting nursing diagnoses and planning goals and interventions. Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) returned appropriate nursing diagnoses, but these were not in line with the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International (NANDA-I) classification as requested. Of all the nursing diagnoses provided, only one was consistent with the most recent version of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International (NANDA-I). Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) is still not specific enough for nursing diagnoses, resulting in incorrect answers in several cases. Conclusions: Using Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses and support the documentation process is time -efficient, but it still requires a certain level of human critical -thinking and factchecking.} }

Drawing on the heuristic-systematic model and the concept of diagnosticity, our approach examines a cognitive model for processing misinformation in GenAI. The study's findings revealed that users with a high-heuristic processing mechanism, which affects positive diagnostic perception, were more likely to proactively discern misinformation than users with low-heuristic processing and low-perceived diagnosticity. When exposed to misinformation from GenAI, users' perceived diagnosticity of misinformation can be accurately predicted by the ways in which they perform heuristic systematic evaluations. With this focus on misinformation processing, this study provides theoretical insights and relevant recommendations for firms to be more resilient in protecting users from the detrimental impacts of misinformation.} }

Methods: In this bibliometric analysis, the WebHarvy software (SysNucleus, India) was used to download data from the Resuscitation journal's website through the technique of web scraping. Next, the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT-4) application programming interface (Open AI, USA) was used to implement the multinomial classification of abstract titles following the ERC 2021 guidelines topics. Results: From 2012 to 2022 a total of 2491 abstracts have been published at ERC congresses. Published abstracts ranged from 88 (in 2020) to 368 (in 2015). On average, the most common ERC guidelines topics were Adult basic life support (50.1\\%), followed by Adult advanced life support (41.5\\%), while Newborn resuscitation and support of transition of infants at birth (2.1\\%) was the least common topic. The findings also highlight that the Basic Life Support and Adult Advanced Life Support ERC guidelines topics have the strongest co-occurrence to all ERC guidelines topics, where the Newborn resuscitation and support of transition of infants at birth (2.1\\%; 52/2491) ERC guidelines topic has the weakest co-occurrence. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence in the bibliometric analysis of abstract titles using the example of resuscitation medicine research over the last decade at ERC conferences using large language models.} }

Intriguingly, capabilities of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) language models beyond the scope of natural language tasks have recently been identified. Here we explored how GPT-4 might be able to perform rudimentary structural biology modeling. We prompted GPT-4 to model 3D structures for the 20 standard amino acids and an alpha-helical polypeptide chain, with the latter incorporating Wolfram mathematical computation. We also used GPT-4 to perform structural interaction analysis between the anti-viral nirmatrelvir and its target, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Geometric parameters of the generated structures typically approximated close to experimental references. However, modeling was sporadically error-prone and molecular complexity was not well tolerated. Interaction analysis further revealed the ability of GPT-4 to identify specific amino acid residues involved in ligand binding along with corresponding bond distances. Despite current limitations, we show the current capacity of natural language generative AI to perform basic structural biology modeling and interaction analysis with atomic-scale accuracy.} }

The research identified three main themes regarding the purposes for which students' prompt generative-AI tools during short story writing: a lack of awareness of purposes, overcoming writer's block, and developing, expanding, and improving the story. The study also identified common characteristics of students' activity systems, including the sophistication of their generative-AI tools, the quality of their stories, and their school's overall academic achievement level, for their prompting of generative-AI tools for the three purposes during short story writing. The study's findings suggest that teachers should be aware of students' purposes for prompting generative-AI tools to provide tailored instructions and scaffolded guidance.

In a comparative study, we evaluated open generative AI models' capacity to acquire data on acute pain in rock climbers comparable to field research. Methods- Fifty-two rock climbers (33 m/19 f; age 29.0 [24.0-35.75] years) were asked to report pain location and intensity during a single climbing session. Five generative pretrained transformer models were tasked with responses to the same questions. Results- Climbers identified the back of the forearm (19.2\\%) and toes (17.3\\%) as primary pain sites, with reported median pain intensity at 4 [3-5] and median maximum pain intensity at 7 [5-8]. Conversely, AI models yielded divergent findings, indicating fingers, hands, shoulders, legs, and feet as primary pain localizations with average and maximum pain intensity ranging from 3 to 4.4 and 5 to 10, respectively. Only two AI models provided references that were untraceable in PubMed and Google searches.

With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving, serving PFMs of mobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable solution for caching and executing PFMs on edge servers with limited computing resources and GPU memory. However, PFMs typically consist of billions of parameters that are computation- and memory-intensive for edge servers during loading and execution. In this article, we investigate edge PFM serving problems for mobile AIGC services of the metaverse. First, we introduce the fundamentals of PFMs and discuss their characteristic fine-tuning and inference methods in edge intelligence. Then, we propose a novel framework of joint model caching and inference for managing models and allocating resources to satisfy users' requests efficiently. Furthermore, considering the in-context learning ability of PFMs, we propose a new metric to evaluate the freshness and relevance between examples in demonstrations and executing tasks, namely the Age of Context (AoC).

Medical education is no exception, as generative AI has the potential to become a powerful tool. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Therefore, we investigated how generative AI is perceived among medical students and utilized within the realm of medical education. Methods: In January 2024, we conducted a study with 123 second-year medical students who had completed a physiology course and laboratory training at Gunma University, Japan. Students used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) 3.5 (OpenAI) for four tasks and evaluated its responses. A survey on the use of generative AI was also conducted. Responses from 117 participants were analyzed, excluding six non-participants. Results: Among the students, 41.9\\% had used ChatGPT. The average scores for tasks 1-4 were 6.5, 4.6, 7.4, and 6.2 out of 10, respectively. Although 13\\% had a negative impression, 54 students found it challenging to apply for medical purposes. However, 64.1\\% expressed a willingness to continue using generative AI, provided its use extended beyond medical contexts. Conclusions: Nearly 60\\% of students had never used generative AI before, which is consistent with general usage trends. Although they were impressed by the speed of generative AI responses, many students found that it lacked precision for medical studies and required additional verification. Limitations of generative AI, such as ``hallucinations,'' were evident in medical education.

The CGWGAN includes three modules: a generator of crystal templates, an atom-infill module, and a crystal screening module. The generator uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce crystal templates embedded with asymmetry units (ASUs), space groups, lattice vectors, and the total number of atoms within the lattice cell, ensuring that the generated templates precisely match all requirements of crystals. These templates become crystal candidates after filling in atoms of different chemical elements. These candidates are screened by M3GNet and the passed ones are subjected to density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to finally verify their stability. As a showcase, the CGWGAN successfully discovers seven novel crystals within the Ba-Ru-O system, demonstrating its effectiveness.

To cut through the hype and understand the use of AI in innovation processes in businesses today, a large-scale survey amongst innovation managers in the USA was conducted, followed by interviews. The findings indicate that the use of AI in innovation processes is high and widespread, with AI being used for more than half of the surveyed firms' innovation projects. Furthermore, AI is used more in the development stage of the innovation process than in the idea or commercialization stages, which counters much of the existing discourse, which focuses on the idea stage. We uncover interesting differences by comparing the use and impact of generative AI with that of more traditional AI. Among these is a significant difference in expected benefits in making employees' jobs more fulfilling - managers believe generative AI is more likely to confer this benefit than traditional AI. This paper offers two valuable contributions. First, it enriches the evolving dialogue at the intersection of AI and innovation management by offering much-needed empirical evidence about practical applications. Second, it provides timely managerial implications by examining relationships between the use of AI and innovation performance and understanding the benefits that AI can confer in the innovation process.} }

By synthesizing the latest research, this study can inform decisions about the appropriate use of Artificial Intelligence in teaching essential writing skills. Increased use of Artificial Intelligence writing tools has sparked debate about their role in academic writing instruction. Universities like Stanford have updated policies around Artificial Intelligence tool usage and academic integrity. The University of California issued guidance acknowledging the prevalence of generative Artificial Intelligence on campuses. Middlebury College banned classroom use of ChatGPT over concerns it could impede critical thinking and writing skill development. Results show that while Artificial Intelligence helps with grammar and style, questions remain about its impact on creativity and critical thinking. However, Artificial Intelligence is not replacing university writing courses. These courses teach critical thinking, research, citation, argumentation, creativity, originality, and ethics, which Artificial Intelligence lacks. Academic writing courses offer a complete learning experience. Artificial Intelligence may improve academic writing but is unlikely to replace traditional courses soon. A balanced approach integrating Artificial Intelligence support while preserving core elements of academic writing education appears most effective for preparing students for diverse writing challenges.} }

For this reason, a variety of text-to-image generating artificial intelligences (AIs) have been devised until now. Nevertheless, the generative AIs introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models.

City brains are large-scale AIs residing in vast digital urban platforms, which manage multiple urban domains including transport, safety, health, and environmental monitoring. They use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate visions of urban futures: visions that are in turn used by policymakers to generate new urban policies. In this paper, we advance a twofold contribution. Theoretically, we develop a critical theory of anticipatory governance in the age of generative AI. More specifically, we focus on technocratic approaches to anticipatory governance, to explain how the act of governing extends into the future by means of predictive AI technology. Our approach is critical in order to expose the dangers that the use of AI (generative AI, in particular) in urban governance poses, and to identify their causes. These dangers include the formation of a policy process that, under the influence of unintelligible LLMs, risks losing transparency and thus accountability, and the marginalization of human stakeholders (citizens, in particular) as the role of AI in the management of cities keeps growing and governance begins to turn posthuman. Empirically, we critically examine an existing city brain project under development in China and ground our critical theory in a real-life example.} }

At quantum and molecular levels, GenAI accelerates the discovery of novel products and enhances the understanding of fundamental phenomena. At larger scales, GenAI improves process design and operational efficiency, contributing to sustainable practices. We present several examples to demonstrate the role of GenAI, including its impact on nanomaterial hardness enhancement, novel catalyst generation, protein design, and the development of autonomous experimental platforms. This multiscale integration demonstrates the potential of GenAI to address complex challenges, drive innovation, and foster advancements in chemical engineering.} }

P. Guilford (1950) speculated that, although artificial intelligence (AI) might one day take over much of human thinking, creativity would remain a uniquely human faculty. However, rapid advancements in AI have led to the recent development of generative models that are capable of producing high-quality creative products, casting some doubt Guilford's prediction. Here, to shed light on this issue, we explored whether human creativity retains distinct value in the emerging domain of AI-assisted digital artworks. Using DALL-E 3, we generated images based on prompts crafted by professional artists, novice artists, and an AI chatbot (ChatGPT-4). Creativity ratings from 299 participants showed that images produced from professional artist prompts were rated as most creative, followed by those generated from AI chatbot prompts, with novice artist prompts rated lowest. Further analysis suggested that this pattern may be partially explained by the semantic distance of the prompts, which followed the same pattern (i.e., professionals > AI chatbot > novices). These findings suggest that, although AI demonstrates impressive creative abilities, the worth of human creativity has not been diminished in the domain of AI-assisted outputs, which supports Guilford's view on the enduring value of human creativity.} }

We focus on three major domains of medical practice where clinicians and technology experts believe generative AI will have substantial immediate and long-term impacts: clinical decision-making, health systems optimization, and the patient-physician relationship. Additionally, we highlight our most important generative AI ethics and equity considerations for these stakeholders. For clinicians, we recommend approaching generative AI similarly to other important biomedical advancements, critically appraising its evidence and utility and incorporating it thoughtfully into practice. For technologists developing generative AI for healthcare applications, we recommend a major frameshift in thinking away from the expectation that clinicians will ``supervise'' generative AI. Rather, these organizations and individuals should hold themselves and their technologies to the same set of high standards expected of the clinical workforce and strive to design high-performing, well-studied tools that improve care and foster the therapeutic relationship, not simply those that improve efficiency or market share. We further recommend deep and ongoing partnerships with clinicians and patients as necessary collaborators in this work. And for healthcare organizations, we recommend pursuing a combination of both incremental and transformative change with generative AI, directing resources toward both endeavors, and avoiding the urge to rapidly displace the human clinical workforce with generative AI. We affirm that the practice of medicine remains a fundamentally human endeavor which should be enhanced by technology, not displaced by it.} }

Materials and Methods: One hundred SoMe posts from the top 3 journals in urology X (formerly Twitter) profiles were collected from August 2022 to October 2023. A freeware generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) tool was developed to autogenerate SoMe posts, which included title summarization, key findings, pertinent emojis, hashtags, and digital object identifier links to the article. Three physicians independently evaluated GPT-generated posts for achieving tetrafecta of accuracy and appropriateness criteria. Fifteen scenarios were created from 5 randomly selected posts from each journal. Each scenario contained both the original and the GPT-generated post for the same article. Five questions were formulated to investigate the posts' likability, shareability, engagement, understandability, and comprehensiveness. The paired posts were then randomized and presented to blinded academic authors and general public through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) responders for preference evaluation. Results: Median time for post autogeneration was 10.2 seconds (interquartile range 8.5-12.5). Of the 150 rated GPT-generated posts, 115 (76.6\\%) met the correctness tetrafecta: 144 (96\\%) accurately summarized the title, 147 (98\\%) accurately presented the articles' main findings, 131 (87.3\\%) appropriately used emojis, and 138 (92\\%) appropriately used hashtags. A total of 258 academic urologists and 493 AMT responders answered the surveys, wherein the GPT-generated posts consistently outperformed the original journals' posts for both academicians and AMT responders (P < .05). Conclusions: Generative artificial intelligence can automate the creation of SoMe posts from urology journal abstracts that are both accurate and preferable by the academic community and general public.} }

However, existing research primarily focuses on generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a better comprehension of the poem's connotations and its key components. Concurrently, the Tang poetry videos generated can significantly contribute to the reduction of cognitive load and the enhancement of understanding during the learning process.

This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT's output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations.

The findings reveal that cognitive and emotional variables, such as perceived behavioural control and emotional well-being are important and necessary conditions for customer loyalty to manifest, and customer innovativeness has an interaction effect on these relationships. This study offers valuable insights for academia and practitioners in regards to leveraging generative AI technologies in order to enhance the customer experience in the hospitality and tourism sector.} }

However, the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within AIoT ecosystems remains largely unexplored. Current research predominantly addresses conventional AIoT frameworks, overlooking the innovative potential of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, Diffusion Models, Transformers, and hybrid architectures, to significantly enhance situational awareness, system optimization, operational robustness, real-time responsiveness, and adaptive decision-making in complex urban environments. AIoT systems continue to face persistent challenges, including data scarcity, poor data quality, limited adaptability, imbalanced datasets, and inadequate contextawareness. This study addresses these gaps by systematically exploring how GenAI can enhance AIoT functionalities across key domains-namely cognitive augmentation, resource efficiency, network traffic, cybersecurity, and anomaly detection-while examining their synergistic potential to improve system-level environmental performance across two interconnected layers in sustainable smart cities. At the operational layer, key findings reveal that integrating GenAI with AIoT systems enhances urban efficiency, adaptability, autonomy, robustness, and resilience by conserving resources, optimizing network traffic flows, securing infrastructures, and detecting anomalies before they escalate. Specifically, the fusion of generative intelligence with federated learning promotes sustainable, energy-efficient AIoT deployments by reducing data transmission, thereby lowering communication overhead and safeguarding user privacy. In networked environments, generative models improve synthetic traffic realism and communication efficiency. They also strengthen cybersecurity through enhanced intrusion prevention and threat detection. Additionally, they enable early identification and mitigation of anomalies, boosting operational efficiency and system robustness. These improvements stabilize sustainable smart city system functioning and prevent disruptive failures. At the environmental layer, as key findings indicate, these operational gains cascade into indirect but tangible ecological benefits, while generative models advance the core pillars of AIoT by enabling proactive, autonomous, context-aware, and self-adaptive systems that further enhance the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities. Thus, while the five domains primarily underpin the operational backbone of urban systems, their cascading effects extend to ecological outcomes. The proposed conceptual framework, distilled from key findings, integrates GenAI and AIoT and highlights both domain-specific advancements and their synergistic interactions. This framework holds significant potential to drive sustainable smart city development by fostering AIoT ecosystems that are more intelligent, resource-efficient, adaptive, secure, robust, and autonomous through the strategic application of generative intelligence. The insights gained from this study provide policymakers, urban planners, system designers, and technology developers with practical guidance to harness GAIoT for enhancing smart city resilience, sustainability, and operational intelligence.} }

The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision technologies has significantly enhanced damage detection accuracy while simultaneously reducing inspection time and operational costs. Despite these advantages, the adoption of AI-based technologies in infrastructure maintenance remains limited due to challenges related to data. One major issue is the lack of comprehensive, task-specific annotated datasets. Another is the poor quality of images captured by drones or mobile devices, which are often affected by noise, blurring, and inconsistent lighting. Although recent advances in generative AI offer promising support for structural health monitoring, it remains unclear which models are best suited for specific tasks. This study examines the use of generative AI in structural health monitoring, focusing on key challenges such as limited datasets and low-quality image restoration. The review covers a range of generative AI technologies, outlining their principles, strengths, limitations, and representative applications to support the selection of appropriate tools for specific tasks. Generative AI models enable accurate image segmentation and structural anomaly detection using limited training data. The paper also explores new opportunities for integrating multimodal generative AI to enhance human-computer interaction in support of structural health monitoring.

However, its integration into education raises concerns about misinformation and over-reliance, particularly among adolescents. Teacher supervision plays a critical role in mitigating these risks and ensuring the effective use of Generative AI in classrooms. Despite the growing interest in Generative AI, there is limited empirical research on its actual impact and the role of teacher oversight.ObjectiveThe purpose of this study is to systematically assess the role of Generative AI in classroom teaching, with a specific focus on how teacher supervision shapes its effectiveness.MethodThis study employed a quasi-experimental design to examine differences in learning outcomes among students under three instructional methods: traditional computer-assisted teaching, Generative AI-assisted teaching without teacher supervision and Generative AI-assisted teaching with teacher supervision. The study was implemented in the context of a two-week Information Science and Technology course in a middle school, involving three classes with 45, 41 and 45 students, respectively. To ensure consistency in teaching styles, all classes were taught by the same experienced teacher. Data collection included a knowledge test to assess knowledge mastery, as well as questionnaires to measure learning satisfaction and engagement. The collected data were analysed using one-way ANOVA to compare the effectiveness of the three teaching methods.Results and ConclusionCompared with traditional computer-assisted teaching, Generative AI-assisted teaching can significantly enhance students' learning satisfaction, but can not improve their learning engagement and knowledge mastery level. Furthermore, in the process of Generative AI-assisted teaching, teacher supervision can significantly increase students' learning engagement and knowledge mastery compared with situations without teacher supervision. This study indicated Generative AI's potential as an educational tool and underscored the essential role of teacher supervision.ImplicationsThis study fills a critical gap by providing empirical evidence on how Generative AI and teacher supervision interact to improve classroom learning outcomes.

While he did not foresee the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), its rapid acceleration raises important issues for his notion of digital writing as a pharmakon. In this essay, we examine Stiegler's view on intelligence, digital writing, technological memory, and neuropower, focusing specifically on his Shanghai lecture and Nanjing Lectures. We compare Stiegler with Catherine Malabou, who examines the nature of intelligence primarily through the lens of neuroscience. We argue that Malabou's view of neuroplasticity in human and artificial brains, and her critique of techno-narcissism in the control over technology, add an important dimension to Stiegler's political critique of education.

By integrating the finite element method (FEM), we construct datasets of frame structures subjected to various conditions. We then developed a conditional graph generation model based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and the attention mechanism. We show that our method can efficiently accomplish the inverse design of various frame structures, including a vehicle's skeleton subjected to five simultaneous constraints. Furthermore, we present comparative experiments against baseline methods to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the GraphDGM.} }

On the one hand, these tools can automate certain aspects of teaching, personalize educational materials, and improve learning efficiency. However, concerns are emerging regarding the impact of AI on the quality of education, the mental health of students, and fundamental academic values. This article reviews the scientific literature on the applications of artificial intelligence in education, with a special emphasis on its impact on student mental health. Based on an analysis of 120 scientific articles, the study automatically extracted data on AI implementation's potential opportunities and threats. A novel aspect of this work is identifying factors that can be considered both opportunities and threats depending on context. In addition, a frequency analysis of keywords and phrases uncovered many opportunities and challenges. All identified aspects are characterized in the article. The article also highlights key barriers to using large language models (LLMs) for detecting student mental health issues, such as underestimating suicide risk, difficulties with interpreting subtle language, biases in training data, lack of cultural sensitivity, and unresolved ethical concerns. These challenges illustrate why generative AI is not yet reliable for supporting student mental health, especially in high-risk situations. One of the key conclusions is that the use of generative AI to support student mental health is seldom addressed in existing review articles, likely due to the current unreliability of this technology.} }

We address this gap by investigating the potentials and concerns that Danish journalists attribute to the impact of artificial intelligence on journalism. Journalists largely acknowledge its potential to streamline news production. While they also express broader concerns about the trustworthiness of journalism and the risk of job displacement, their more immediate worry lies in the impact of artificial intelligence on job meaningfulness and professional identity. These findings reveal a differentiated perspective on the profession-wide and individual impacts of artificial intelligence on journalism. Furthermore, journalists emphasise their human qualities and skills such as nuanced judgement, empathy, and creativity as beyond artificial intelligence's capabilities.

This paper considers the problem of improving editorial and publishing processes, namely self-publishing, when designing book covers using machine learning and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) methods. When choosing a book, readers often have certain expectations regarding the design of the publication, including the color of the cover. These expectations can be called color preferences, and they can depend on the genre of the book, its target audience, and even personal associations. Cultural context can also influence color choice, as certain colors can symbolize different emotions or moods in different cultures. Cluster analysis of book cover images of the same genre allows us to identify color preferences inherent in the genre, which is proposed to be used when designing new covers. The capabilities of generative services for creating and improving cover designs are also investigated. An improved flow chart for using GAI in creating book covers in the process of self-publishing is proposed, which includes new stages, namely exploring, conditioning, and evolving. At these stages, the designer creates prompts for GAI and examines how they and GAI's issuances correspond to the task. Conditioning allows for even more precise adjustment of prompts to features of each book, and the evolving stage also includes post-processing of results already received from GAI. Post-processing, in turn, can be performed both in generative services and by a designer. The experiment allowed us to use the machine-learning method to determine which colors are most often found in book cover layouts of one of the genres and to check whether these colors correspond to harmonious color palettes. In accordance with the proposed scheme of the design process using generative artificial intelligence, versions of book cover layouts of a given genre were obtained.} }

There are external and internal factors that are part of the success of entrepreneurial initiatives. Relevant factors that make decision-making effective include the technological environment, as an external factor, and innovation, as an internal factor. Methods: This study reviews the existing literature on implementing GAI in business decision-making. It assesses its short-, medium- and long-term effects, considering the interaction between GAI and human judgment. Challenges related to uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity are examined, and the relevant literature is reviewed to understand these aspects comprehensively. Results: The review shows that, despite the advanced capabilities of GAI to analyze data and generate patterns, human judgment remains crucial in situations of high uncertainty. The results suggest that combining GAI with human expertise can improve the accuracy and efficiency of strategic decision-making by integrating the strengths of both parties. Conclusions: The implementation of GAI can offer significant improvements in the efficiency and accuracy of business decisions. However, human judgment and experience remain essential, especially in uncertain contexts. The key to maximizing the benefits of GAI lies in finding the right balance between artificial intelligence and human capital.} }

This paper summarizes current research on the use of generative AI in psychology and its impact on the theory and practice of psychological science. One of the primary applications of generative AI is in psychodiagnostics, where it can be used to automate the creation of diagnostic tools and interpret test results, analyze large volumes of data, and provide more accurate diagnostic conclusions. This significantly reduces the workload on psychologists while simultaneously increasing the efficiency of diagnostic processes. In the field of psychotherapy, generative AI can be used to create individualized therapeutic programs that provide continuous support to users, which is particularly important when access to qualified specialists is limited. Another important aspect is the use of generative AI in psychological research: AI can help in creating behavior models, predicting mental disorders, developing new research methodologies, reducing routine administrative burdens, and more. While generative AI revolutionizes the work of psychologists, it simultaneously creates complex issues related to ethics, confidentiality, accuracy of diagnostic and therapeutic methods, and more. To ensure that generative AI is effective and ethical, clear standards and regulatory frameworks must be developed for its use. Therefore, the authors propose recommendations for the implementation of AI in psychological practice, emphasizing the need to develop specific guidelines to address these issues. The role of psychologists in ensuring the ethical use of AI, the necessity of continuous monitoring, and the assessment of its impact on users are also discussed. Overall, generative AI holds great potential for psychological research and practice, but its implementation requires careful planning and consideration of ethical aspects to ensure safety and effectiveness.} }

Objective This study aimed to develop and evaluate a brief intervention to increase PhD nursing students' knowledge of appropriate applications for using generative AI tools in health care. Methods We created didactic lectures and laboratory-based activities to introduce generative AI to students enrolled in a nursing PhD data science and visualization course. Students were provided with a subscription to Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) 4.0, a general-purpose generative AI tool, for use in and outside the class. During the didactic portion, we described generative AI and its current and potential future applications in health care, including examples of appropriate and inappropriate applications. In the laboratory sessions, students were given three tasks representing different use cases of generative AI in health care practice and research (clinical decision support, patient decision support, and scientific communication) and asked to engage with ChatGPT on each. Students ( n = 10) independently wrote a brief reflection for each task evaluating safety (accuracy, hallucinations) and usability (ease of use, usefulness, and intention to use in the future). Reflections were analyzed using directed content analysis. Results Students were able to identify the strengths and limitations of ChatGPT in completing all three tasks and developed opinions on whether they would feel comfortable using ChatGPT for similar tasks in the future. All of them reported increasing their self-rated competency in generative AI by one to two points on a five-point rating scale. Conclusion This brief educational intervention supported doctoral nursing students in understanding the appropriate uses of ChatGPT, which may support their ability to appraise and use these tools in their future work.} }

Although repeatedly questioned by many critics per se value-neutral generative AI stands a good chance of becoming an important tool for presenting chemical information throughout all strata of society. Additionally, it can support the spread of science-based opinions on chemistry to the public and help popularize science in general as well. AI allows virtually every scientist to become a major player in science communication. This could lead to a containment of chemophobia. However, the use of AI as a communication tool requires continuous education, personal development and training of those who use it, in this case chemists and scientists in general. They will play a crucial role as arbiters of the appropriateness, adequacy and factual accuracy of the content generated by generative AI. The democratization of communication made possible by generative AI entails the need to adapt the dialogue to the communication preferences, demography and education of the interlocutors. Thus, generative AI empowers both those who enter the prompts and those who receive the subsequent results. Most scientists do not realize it, but generative AI puts the public, not scientists, at the center of communication. It is important to recognize this and use generative AI to target communication, education, and overall community development. The clash of narratives that may be a natural consequence of the growing number of generative AI users and the increasing amount of content being created may, perhaps unexpectedly for many, lead to the opposite result - a new Enlightenment. Either way, chemists would do well to be there; for their ability to understand the laws of matter, the beginning and end of things; for the dual nature of chemistry as an art and a science.} }

Several studies assessed its efficacy in improving medical studies learning, and others assessed medical students' knowledge and attitudes about generative AI. So, we aim to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of generative AI among medical students in Egypt. Methods In 2024, a cross-sectional study using a semi-structured questionnaire was performed, targeting 423 students as a convenient sample from 10 selected Egyptian universities by simple random sampling. The questionnaire was distributed via online platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, X, Telegram, and Messenger. Data about sociodemographic characteristics, students' general knowledge about generative AI and its limitations, and their attitudes and practices, respectively, were collected. Results About 23 (61.5\\%) of the studied students had satisfactory knowledge about generative AI and (44.7\\%) had a positive attitude. Males demonstrated significantly higher knowledge than females (69.3\\% vs. 55\\%, P-value = 0.003). Knowledge level also differs significantly by university (P-value < 0.001), with Suez-Canal and 6th October university students achieving the highest satisfactory scores. Key significant predictors that affect knowledge level include gender, university and study phase according to binary logistic regression results. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between satisfactory knowledge and Practice level (r = 0.303, P < 0.001). Finally, most students use generative AI to check Grammar and prepare their homework or assignments. Conclusion and recommendations There is moderate knowledge and positive attitude about AI that were reflected in medical students' practice. However, knowledge about AI influenced by gender, university and study phase. Importantly, better knowledge significantly correlates with greater generative AI practice. Offering specialized courses or faculty modules about AI enhance awareness among Egyptian medical students. Such initiatives will enable them to gain knowledge and apply it effectively and wisely.} }

However, research on secondary school students specializing in IT at an early stage has received relatively little attention in this field. The aim of this study is to assess how vocational secondary school IT students utilize Generative artificial intelligence in learning programming. The study employed a survey-based methodology, where students with varying levels of knowledge were surveyed to understand their AI usage patterns. The sample consisted of students from vocational IT schools, and data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and independent samples t-tests. The results indicate that students with different levels of knowledge use AI tools differently, with ChatGPT being the most popular tool. The study further highlights that AI usage brings significant benefits, such as providing a personalized learning experience and enabling quick error correction. However, excessive reliance on AI tools may hinder students from acquiring fundamental programming skills. The findings support the idea that while AI can effectively complement teachers' explanations, overdependence on it can be risky, potentially reducing students' creativity and problem-solving abilities. The study emphasizes the crucial role of educators in teaching the responsible and ethical use of artificial intelligence. The results of this research offer new perspectives on the effective integration of Generative artificial intelligence into vocational secondary school programming education and suggest further studies to compare its applications at the university level. However, the study acknowledges certain limitations, such as the potential bias of self-reported data, which may affect the generalizability of the results. Unlike other studies, the age groups we surveyed, and the cohorts formed from them are nearly evenly distributed, making our sample representative of the region in question.} }

Generative AI (GAI) applications in particular offer interesting possibilities here, for example, to generate texts, images or computer codes with the help of algorithms and to integrate these as useful supports in various AM processes. This paper examines the opportunities that GAI offers specifically for additive manufacturing. There are currently relatively few publications that deal with the topic of GAI in AM. Much of the information has only been published in preprints. There, the focus has been on algorithms for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). This summarised presentation of the state of the art of GAI in AM is new and the link to specific use cases is this first comprehensive case study on GAI in AM processes. Building on this, three specific use cases are then developed in which generative AI tools are used to optimise AM processes. Finally, a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis is carried out on the general possibilities of GAI, which forms the basis for an in-depth discussion on the sensible use of GAI tools in AM. The key findings of this work are that GAI can be integrated into AM processes as a useful support, making these processes faster and more creative, as well as to make the process information digitally recordable and usable. This current and future potential, as well as the technical implementation of GAI into AM, is also presented and explained visually. It is also shown where the use of generative AI tools can be useful and where current or future potential risks may arise.} }

The potential of GenAI in education is vast. By using algorithms and data, GenAI can create original content that can be used to augment traditional teaching methods, creating a more interactive and personalized learning experience. In addition, GenAI can be utilized as an assessment tool and for providing feedback to students using generated content. For instance, it can be used to create custom quizzes, generate essay prompts, or even grade essays. The use of GenAI as an assessment tool can reduce the workload of teachers and help students receive prompt feedback on their work. Incorporating GenAI in educational settings also poses challenges related to academic integrity. With availability of GenAI models, students can use them to study or complete their homework assignments, which can raise concerns about the authenticity and authorship of the delivered work.

In this context, prompt engineering has emerged as a critical skill for optimizing AI-generated outputs. However, research on how higher education students interact with these technologies remains limited, particularly in non-English-speaking contexts. This exploratory study examines how 102 higher education students in Chile formulated prompts in Spanish and how their techniques influenced the responses generated by ChatGPT (free version 3.5). A quantitative analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between prompt techniques and response quality. Two emergent prompt engineering strategies were identified: the Guide Contextualization Strategy and the Specific Purpose Strategy. The Guide Contextualization Strategy focused on providing explicit contextual information to guide ChatGPT's responses, aligning with few-shot prompting, while the Specific Purpose Strategy emphasized defining the request's purpose, aligning with structured objective formulation strategies. The regression analysis indicated that the Guide Contextualization Strategy had a greater impact on response quality, reinforcing the importance of contextual information in effective interactions with large language models. As an exploratory study, these findings provide preliminary evidence on prompt engineering strategies in Spanish, a relatively unexplored area in artificial intelligence education research. Based on these results, a methodological framework is proposed, encompassing four key dimensions: grammatical skills; prompt strategies; response from the large language model; and evaluation of response quality. This framework lays the groundwork for future artificial intelligence digital literacy interventions, fostering critical and effective engagement with generative artificial intelligence while also highlighting the need for further research to validate and expand these initial insights.} }

To address these challenges, we develop a universal resource-efficient generative incentive mechanism framework, in which we design resource-efficient methods for network overhead reduction, formulate appropriate incentive mechanisms for the resource allocation problem, and utilize generative diffusion models (GDMs) to find the optimal incentive mechanism solutions. Furthermore, we conduct a case study on resource-constrained mobile edge networks, employing model partitioning for efficient AI task offloading, and proposing a GDM-based Stackelberg model to motivate edge devices to contribute computing resources for mobile edge intelligence. Finally, we propose several open directions that could contribute to the future popularity of generative mobile edge networks.} }

This potential for bias has grown progressively more important in recent years as GAI has become increasingly integrated in multiple critical sectors, such as healthcare, consumer lending, and employment. While much of the study of gender bias in popular GAI systems is focused on text-based GAI such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini (formerly Bard), this article describes the results of a confirmatory experiment of gender bias in visual GAI systems. The authors argue that the potential for gender bias in visual GAI systems is potentially more troubling than bias in textual GAI because of the superior memorability of images and the capacity for emotional communication that images represent. They go on to offer four potential approaches to gender bias in visual GAI based on the roles visual GAI could play in modern society. The article concludes with a discussion of how dominant societal values could influence a choice between those four potential approaches to gender bias in visual GAI and some suggestions for further research.} }

For discriminative tasks, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are still major AI techniques. Vision transformers (ViT), inspired by the transformer architecture in natural language processing, has emerged as useful techniques for discriminating retinal images. ViT can attain excellent results when pretrained at sufficient scale and transferred to specific tasks with fewer images, compared to conventional CNN. Many studies found better performance of ViT, compared to CNN, for common tasks such as diabetic retinopathy screening on color fundus photographs (CFP) and segmentation of retinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is the main AI technique in generative AI in retinal imaging. Novel images generated by GAN can be applied for training AI models in imbalanced or inadequate datasets. Foundation models are also recent advances in retinal imaging. They are pretrained with huge datasets, such as millions of CFP and OCT images and fine-tuned for downstream tasks with much smaller datasets. A foundation model, RETFound, which was self-supervised and found to discriminate many eye and systemic diseases better than supervised models. Large language models are foundation models that may be applied for text-related tasks, like reports of retinal angiography. Whereas AI technology moves forward fast, real-world use of AI models moves slowly, making the gap between development and deployment even wider. Strong evidence showing AI models can prevent visual loss may be required to close this gap.} }

In this paper, we use a disruptive-disrupting framework to discuss the dual nature of generative AI and LLMs and offer recommendations for social work researchers and journal editors that include guidance around data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. Researchers must use great caution when deploying generative AI technologies, meticulously examining, verifying, and taking accountability for the text and analyses produced by these instruments. Likewise, journal editors will need to implement quality control procedures and ethical standards to guide and evaluate the use of these technologies in social work research. We consider the recommendations offered here as a point of departure for disciplinary conversations about the role of generative AI and LLMs in social work research.} }

As a result, educators' concerns in the higher education sector quickly emerged. Many organizations and experts have addressed these concerns through recommendations. In this conceptual paper, we draw from the Integrated Model for Academic Integrity through a Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Lens to examine and stimulate discussion from twelve documents that focus on using GenAI with integrity. We identified recommendations suitable for the individual (micro), the departmental/program (meso), the institutional (macro), and the interinstitutional/ national/ international (mega) levels concerning two core elements of the model: ``high-impact professional learning for individuals and groups'' and ``local-level leadership and microcultures.'' Suggestions around the core element ``scholarship, research and inquiry'' were lacking at the micro and meso levels; likewise, recommendations for the core element ``learning spaces, pedagogies, and technologies'' were also absent at the meso, macro, and mega levels. We acknowledge that these recommendations focus on learning, involve various stakeholders, and go beyond student conduct, which aligns with current approaches to academic integrity. However, some gaps need further exploration. We highlight the need to develop more specific and practical guidance and resources for educational stakeholders around GenAI issues related to academic integrity, explore how to better support networks and leaders in higher education in creating the conditions for ethical GenAI use, and emphasizing the need for an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion lens on GenAI.} }

Despite GenAI technology's latest launch in the academia sector, very little has been done to evaluate its effects. To examine what factors impact the continuous intention to use GenAI, this paper contemplates incorporating the technology acceptance model with self-determination theory. University students were requested to fill out questionnaire forms that were designed to gather data for the proposed model. A hybrid approach combining a linear partial least squares structural equation modeling model with compensation and a non-linear artificial neural network (ANN) model without compensation is used to investigate the effect of CI on the use of GenAI as an educational tool. The empirical results indicated that perceived usefulness and autonomy are significant predictors of the continued intention to use GenAI in the Thai context. However, the CI was unaffected by perceived ease of use. Additionally, the ANN model indicates that relatedness is the most important predictor. Overall, theoretical and practical ramifications are addressed.} }

In this study, we explore and compare the main characteristics of existing educational chatbots. Then, we propose a new theoretical framework for blended learning with intelligent chatbots integration enabling students to interact online and instructors to create and manage their courses using generative AI tools.

Therefore, this study, grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), employs a snowball sampling method to survey 460 university students, utilizing structural equation modeling to analyze the relationships among their AI literacy (AIL), psychological need satisfaction (PNS), creative self-efficacy (CSE), self-regulated learning (SRL), and innovative behavior (IB). The results indicate that AIL does not directly influence learners' IB. PNS, CSE, and SRL serve as mediators between AIL and IB. Furthermore, AIL influences learners' PNS and CSE in innovative activities, which in turn affects their use of SRL to adjust their innovation processes, thereby promoting the application of GAI in generating IB.} }
