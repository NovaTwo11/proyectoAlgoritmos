CS50.ai encapsulates a variety of AI-based tools designed to enhance students' learning by approximating a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio. We showcase: "Explain Highlighted Code," a Visual Studio (VS) Code extension that provides just-in-time explanations of code snippets; style50, a VS Code extension that offers formatting suggestions and explanations thereof; and our "CS50 Duck," an AI-based chatbot for course-related questions, implemented both as a VS Code extension and as a standalone web application. We also demonstrate the integration of our tools into Ed, the course's discussion forum. This demo will illustrate the functionality and effectiveness of these tools as well as the pedagogical "guardrails" that we put in place to ensure secure and fair usage of these tools, while sharing insights from our own experience therewith this past summer and fall.} }

It examines how effectively new generative AI-based chatbots can handle customer emotions and explores their impact on determining the point at which a customer-machine interaction should be transferred to a human agent to prevent customer disengagement, referred to as the Switch Point (SP). Design/methodology/approach-To evaluate the capabilities of new generative AI-based chatbots in managing emotions, ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini and Copilot are tested using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire Short-Form (TEIQue-SF). A reference framework is developed to illustrate the shift in the Switch Point (SP). Findings-Using the four-intelligence framework (mechanical, analytical, intuitive and empathetic), this study demonstrates that, despite advancements in AI's ability to address emotions in customer service, even the most advanced chatbots-such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot-still fall short of replicating the empathetic capabilities of human intelligence (HI). The concept of artificial emotional awareness (AEA) is introduced to characterize the intuitive intelligence of new generative AI chatbots in understanding customer emotions and triggering the SP. A complementary rather than replacement perspective of HI and AI is proposed, highlighting the impact of generative AI on the SP. Research limitations/implications-This study is exploratory in nature and requires further theoretical development and empirical validation. Practical implications-The study has only an exploratory character with respect to the possible real impact of the introduction of the new generative AI-based chatbots on collaborative approaches to the integration of humans and technology in Society 5.0. Originality/value-Customer Relationship Management managers can use the proposed framework as a guide to adopt a dynamic approach to HI-AI collaboration in AI-driven customer service.} }

At the same time, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a very successful paradigm for a variety of machine learning tasks. In this survey, we discuss the state of the art, opportunities and open research questions in applying RL to generative AI. In particular, we will discuss three types of applications, namely, RL as an alternative way for generation without specified objectives; as a way for generating outputs while concurrently maximizing an objective function; and, finally, as a way of embedding desired characteristics, which cannot be easily captured by means of an objective function, into the generative process. We conclude the survey with an in-depth discussion of the opportunities and challenges in this fascinating emerging area.} }

Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this article aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.} }
