Abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of generative artificial
   intelligence (GenAI) in enhancing marketing content. However, its impact
   on consumer behavior has remained empirically untested. In response to
   social media platforms mandating the disclosure of GenAI content, we
   investigate how followers perceive brands that use GenAI for content
   creation. Drawing from literature on algorithm aversion and brand
   authenticity, the results of three experimental studies indicate that
   brands' GenAI adoption induces negative attitudinal and behavioral
   follower reactions. These effects are mediated by followers' perceptions
   of brand authenticity and can be triggered by GenAI disclosure. Negative
   reactions are attenuated if GenAI is used to assist humans in content
   creation rather than to replace them through automation. Our findings
   underscore the need for nuance in brands' GenAI adoption to unlock
   economic benefits without compromising on relationships with consumers.},

Abstract = {The aim of this project was to understand student perspectives on
   generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies such as Chat
   generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), in order to inform changes
   to the University of Liverpool Academic Integrity code of practice. The
   survey for this study was created by a library student team and vetted
   through focus groups. A total of 2555 students participated in the
   survey. Results showed that only 7\% of students who responded had not
   heard of any GAI technologies, whilst over half had used or considered
   using these for academic purposes. The majority of students (54.1\%)
   were supportive or somewhat supportive of using tools such as Grammarly,
   but 70.4\% were unsupportive or somewhat unsupportive towards students
   using tools such as ChatGPT to write their whole essay. Students who had
   higher levels of confidence in their academic writing were less likely
   to use or consider using them for academic purposes, and were also less
   likely to be supportive of other students using them. Most students
   (41.1\%) also thought there should be a university wide policy on when
   these technologies are or are not appropriate to use. The results of
   this research suggest that students require clear policies on the use of
   GAI and that these technologies should not be banned from university,
   but consideration must be made to ensure different groups of students
   have equal access to the technologies.},

   Intelligence Context: The Case of ChatGPT},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence has been attracting the attention of educational
   researchers recently, especially ChatGPT as a generative artificial
   intelligence tool. The context of generative artificial intelligence
   could impact different aspects of students' learning, such as the
   motivational aspect. The present research intended to investigate the
   characteristics of students' task motivation in the artificial
   intelligence context, specifically in the ChatGPT context. The
   researchers interviewed 15 students about their experiences with ChatGPT
   to collect data. The researchers used inductive and deductive content
   analysis to investigate students' motivation when learning with ChatGPT.
   To arrive at the categories and sub-categories of students' motivation,
   the researchers used the MAXQDA 2022. Five main categories emerged: task
   enjoyment, reported effort, result assessment, perceived relevance, and
   interaction. Each category comprised at least two sub-categories, and
   each sub-category was further organized into codes. The results
   indicated more positive characteristics of motivation than negative
   ones. The previous results could be due to the conversational or social
   aspect of the chatbot, enabling relationships with humans and enabling
   the maintenance of good quality conversations with them. We conclude
   that a generative AI could be utilized in educational settings to
   promote students' motivation to learn and thus raise their learning
   achievement.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is able to collect, extract, digest,

   first surgical applications of generative artificial intelligence are
   applied, this perspective paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview
   of current applications and future perspectives for the application of
   generative artificial intelligence in surgery, from preoperative
   planning to training. Generative artificial intelligence can be used
   before surgery for planning and decision support by extracting patient
   information and providing patients with information and simulation
   regarding the procedure. Intraoperatively, generative artificial
   intelligence can document data that is normally not captured as
   intraoperative adverse events or provide information to help
   decision-making. Postoperatively, GAIs can help with patient discharge
   and follow-up. The ability to provide real-time feedback and store it
   for later review is an important capability of GAIs. GAI applications
   are emerging as highly specialized, task-specific tools for tasks such
   as data extraction, synthesis, presentation, and communication within
   the realm of surgery. GAIs have the potential to play a pivotal role in
   facilitating interaction between surgeons and artificial intelligence.

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence, the latest chapter of the technological
   revolution, has a tremendous potential to change every area of our
   lives. This article has focused on a specific form of artificial
   intelligence, namely generative intelligence, which facilitates the
   generation of content in all its forms (text, image, video, audio,
   programming codes, etc.). Thus, generative artificial intelligence has a
   crucial role in education, allowing for the personalisation of
   educational content and facilitating the learning process. In the
   beginning, the paper has highlighted conceptual delimitations regarding
   artificial intelligence and its applications in education, along with
   advantages and limitations, highlighting that the adoption of generative
   artificial intelligence solutions, such as ChatGPT, in higher education
   in economics has been relatively underexplored in the literature. In
   order to cover these gaps identified in the literature, have been
   presented, in the second part of the paper, the methodology and results
   of an exploratory research, conducted on a sample of 364 undergraduate
   and master's students at the Faculty of Business and Tourism within the
   Bucharest University of Economic Studies. The research has provided
   insight into the perception of Business Administration students
   regarding these applications. The results indicated a high level of
   awareness and interest in content generation models and highlighted that

Abstract = {Multiscale design of catalyst layers (CLs) is important to advancing

   deployment, which has nevertheless been greatly hampered by the complex
   interplay among multiscale CL components, high synthesis cost and vast
   design space. We lack rational design and optimization techniques that
   can accurately reflect the nanostructure-performance relationship and
   cost-effectively search the design space. Here, we fill this gap with a
   deep generative artificial intelligence (AI) framework, GLIDER, that
   integrates recent generative AI, data-driven surrogate techniques and
   collective intelligence to efficiently search the optimal CL
   nanostructures driven by their electrochemical performance. GLIDER
   achieves realistic multiscale CL digital generation by leveraging the
   dimensionality-reduction ability of quantized vector-variational
   autoencoder. The powerful generative capability of GLIDER allows the
   efficient search of the optimal design parameters for the
   Pt-carbon-ionomer nanostructures of CLs. We also demonstrate that GLIDER
   is transferable to other fuel cell electrode microstructure generation,
   e.g., fibrous gas diffusion layers and solid oxide fuel cell anode.
   GLIDER is of potential as a digital tool for the design and optimization

   Digital twins, which are in silico replications of an individual and its
   environment, have advanced clinical decision-making and prognostication
   in cardiovascular medicine. The technology enables personalized
   simulations of clinical scenarios, prediction of disease risk, and
   strategies for clinical trial augmentation. Current applications of
   cardiovascular digital twins have integrated multi-modal data into
   mechanistic and statistical models to build physiologically accurate
   cardiac replicas to enhance disease phenotyping, enrich diagnostic
   workflows, and optimize procedural planning. Digital twin technology is
   rapidly evolving in the setting of newly available data modalities and
   advances in generative artificial intelligence, enabling dynamic and
   comprehensive simulations unique to an individual. These twins fuse
   physiologic, environmental, and healthcare data into machine learning
   and generative models to build real-time patient predictions that can
   model interactions with the clinical environment to accelerate
   personalized patient care. This review summarizes digital twins in
   cardiovascular medicine and their potential future applications by
   incorporating new personalized data modalities. It examines the
   technical advances in deep learning and generative artificial
   intelligence that broaden the scope and predictive power of digital
   twins. Finally, it highlights the individual and societal challenges as
   well as ethical considerations that are essential to realizing the

   existence of two distinct generative levels in GenAI: one leading to the
   generation of new artifacts and the other leading to the generation of
   GenAI models themselves. We are also able to characterize the
   generativity of both of these levels, thus specifically confirming the

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence and large language models are the
   continuation of a technological revolution in information processing
   that began with the invention of the transistor in 1947. These
   technologies, driven by transformer architectures for artificial neural
   networks, are poised to broadly influence society. It is already
   apparent that these technologies will be adapted to drive innovation in
   education. Medical education is a high-risk activity: Information that
   is incorrectly taught to a student may go unrecognized for years until a
   relevant clinical situation appears in which that error can lead to
   patient harm. In this article, I discuss the principal limitations to
   the use of generative artificial intelligence in medical
   education-hallucination, bias, cost, and security-and suggest some
   approaches to confronting these problems. Additionally, I identify the
   potential applications of generative artificial intelligence to medical
   education, including personalized instruction, simulation, feedback,
   evaluation, augmentation of qualitative research, and performance of
   critical assessment of the existing scientific literature.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds the potential to
   transform the delivery, cultivation and evaluation of human learning.
   Here the authors examine the integration of GenAI as a tool for human
   learning, addressing its promises and challenges from a holistic
   viewpoint that integrates insights from learning sciences, educational
   technology and human-computer interaction. GenAI promises to enhance
   learning experiences by scaling personalized support, diversifying
   learning materials, enabling timely feedback and innovating assessment
   methods. However, it also presents critical issues such as model
   imperfections, ethical dilemmas and the disruption of traditional
   assessments. Thus, cultivating AI literacy and adaptive skills is
   imperative for facilitating informed engagement with GenAI technologies.
   Rigorous research across learning contexts is essential to evaluate
   GenAI's effect on human cognition, metacognition and creativity.
   Humanity must learn with and about GenAI, ensuring that it becomes a
   powerful ally in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation, rather than a
   crutch that undermines our intellectual abilities.
   This Perspective describes the roles of generative AI in providing
   personalized support, diversity and innovative assessment in learning.
   However, it also raises ethical concerns and highlights issues such as
   model imperfection, underscoring the need for AI literacy and

   a narrative exploring the implementation of generative AI in nursing
   education and offers a guide for its strategic use. The exploration

   for efficiency and innovation while posing challenges of transparency,
   ethical use, and AI literacy. By establishing ethical guidelines,
   fostering AI literacy, and promoting responsible implementation in

Abstract = {It is increasingly common to interact with products that seem
   ``intelligent{''}, although the label ``artificial intelligence{''} may
   have been replaced by other euphemisms. Since November 2022, with the
   emergence of the ChatGPT tool, there has been an exponential increase in
   the use of artificial intelligence in all areas. Although ChatGPT is
   just one of many generative artificial intelligence technologies, its
   impact on teaching and learning processes has been significant. This
   article reflects on the advantages, disadvantages, potentials, limits,
   and challenges of generative artificial intelligence technologies in
   education to avoid the biases inherent in extremist positions. To this
   end, we conducted a systematic review of both the tools and the
   scientific production that have emerged in the six months since the
   appearance of ChatGPT. Generative artificial intelligence is extremely
   powerful and improving at an accelerated pace, but it is based on large
   language models with a probabilistic basis, which means that they have
   no capacity for reasoning or comprehension and are therefore susceptible
   to containing errors that need to be contrasted. On the other hand, many
   of the problems associated with these technologies in educational
   contexts already existed before their appearance, but now, due to their
   power, we cannot ignore them, and we must assume what our speed of
   response will be to analyse and incorporate these tools into our
   teaching practice.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence provides both opportunities and
   challenges for higher education. Existing literature has not properly
   investigated how this technology would impact assessment in higher
   education. This scoping review took a forward-thinking approach to
   investigate how generative artificial intelligence transforms assessment
   in higher education. We used the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews to
   select articles for review and report the results. In the screening, we
   retrieved 969 articles and selected 32 empirical studies for analysis.
   Most of the articles were published in 2023. We used three
   levels-students, teachers, and institutions-to analyses the articles.
   Our results suggested that assessment should be transformed to cultivate
   students' self-regulated learning skills, responsible learning, and
   integrity. To successfully transform assessment in higher education, the
   review suggested that (i) teacher professional development activities
   for assessment, AI, and digital literacy should be provided, (ii)
   teachers' beliefs about human and AI assessment should be strengthened,
   and (iii) teachers should be innovative and holistic in their teaching
   to reflect the assessment transformation. Educational institutions are
   recommended to review and rethink their assessment policies, as well as

Abstract = {There has been widespread media commentary about the potential impact of
   generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT on the Education
   field, but little examination at scale of how educators believe teaching

   range of teaching levels, experience levels, discipline areas, and
   regions about the impact of AI on teaching and assessment, the ways that
   they believe teaching and assessment should change, and the key
   motivations for changing their practices. The majority of teachers felt
   that generative AI would have a major or profound impact on teaching and
   assessment, though a sizeable minority felt it would have a little or no
   impact. Teaching level, experience, discipline area, region, and gender
   all significantly influenced perceived impact of generative AI on
   teaching and assessment. Higher levels of awareness of generative AI
   predicted higher perceived impact, pointing to the possibility of an
   `ignorance effect'. Thematic analysis revealed the specific curriculum,
   pedagogy, and assessment changes that teachers feel are needed as a
   result of generative AI, which centre around learning with AI,
   higher-order thinking, ethical values, a focus on learning processes and
   face-to-face relational learning. Teachers were most motivated to change
   their teaching and assessment practices to increase the performance
   expectancy of their students and themselves. We conclude by discussing

Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Background: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are
   increasingly being utilized across various fields, with considerable
   interest and concern regarding their potential application in medical
   education. These technologies, such as Chat GPT and Bard, can generate
   new content and have a wide range of possible applications.Objective:
   This study aimed to synthesize the potential opportunities and
   limitations of generative AI in medical education. It sought to identify
   prevalent themes within recent literature regarding potential
   applications and challenges of generative AI in medical education and
   use these to guide future areas for exploration.Methods: We conducted a
   scoping review, following the framework by Arksey and O'Malley, of
   English language articles published from 2022 onward that discussed
   generative AI in the context of medical education. A literature search
   was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar
   databases. We screened articles for inclusion, extracted data from
   relevant studies, and completed a quantitative and qualitative synthesis
   of the data.Results: Thematic analysis revealed diverse potential
   applications for generative AI in medical education, including
   self-directed learning, simulation scenarios, and writing assistance.
   However, the literature also highlighted significant challenges, such as
   issues with academic integrity, data accuracy, and potential detriments
   to learning. Based on these themes and the current state of the
   literature, we propose the following 3 key areas for investigation:
   developing learners' skills to evaluate AI critically, rethinking
   assessment methodology, and studying human-AI interactions. Conclusions:
   The integration of generative AI in medical education presents exciting
   opportunities, alongside considerable challenges. There is a need to
   develop new skills and competencies related to AI as well as thoughtful,
   nuanced approaches to examine the growing use of generative AI in
   Medical education.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly increased capacity
   for producing textual, visual and auditory outputs, yet there are
   ongoing concerns regarding the quality of those outputs. There is an
   urgent need to develop students' evaluative judgement - the capability
   to judge the quality of work of self and others - in recognition of this
   new reality. In this conceptual paper, we describe the intersection
   between evaluative judgement and generative AI with a view to
   articulating how assessment practices can help students learn to work
   productively with generative AI. We propose three foci: (1) developing
   evaluative judgement of generative AI outputs; (2) developing evaluative
   judgement of generative AI processes; and (3) generative AI assessment
   of student evaluative judgements. We argue for developing students'
   capabilities to identify and calibrate quality of work - uniquely human
   capabilities at a time of technological acceleration - through existing
   formative assessment strategies. These approaches circumvent and
   interrupt students' uncritical usage of generative AI. The relationship
   between evaluative judgement and generative AI is more than just the
   application of human judgement to machine outputs. We have a collective
   responsibility, as educators and learners, to ensure that humans do not
   relinquish their roles as arbiters of quality.},

   enabled new paradigms of machine processing, shifting from data-driven,
   discriminative AI tasks toward sophisticated, creative tasks through
   generative AI. Leveraging deep generative models, generative AI is
   capable of producing novel and realistic content across a broad spectrum
   (e.g., texts, images, or programming code) for various domains based on
   basic user prompts. In this article, we offer a comprehensive overview
   of the fundamentals of generative AI with its underpinning concepts and
   prospects. We provide a conceptual introduction to relevant terms and
   techniques, outline the inherent properties that constitute generative
   AI, and elaborate on the potentials and challenges. We underline the
   necessity for researchers and practitioners to comprehend the
   distinctive characteristics of generative artificial intelligence in
   order to harness its potential while mitigating its risks and to
   contribute to a principal understanding.},

Abstract = {Interdisciplinary advancements, such as generative artificial
   intelligence (AI) and digital supply chains, can significantly
   contribute to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs),
   particularly within tourism. This paper illuminates how it works well,
   focusing on the underexplored area of Environmental, Social, and
   Governance (ESG) performance within small and medium-sized tourism
   enterprises (SMEs) in China. Through a survey of 429 international SMEs,
   we apply the Resource-Based View and Dynamic Capabilities Theory to
   investigate how generative AI, such as ChatGPT, in digital supply chains
   can enhance innovation, collaboration, and, ultimately, ESG performance.
   The empirical findings underscore the pivotal role of generative AI in
   augmenting ESG performance via bolstering innovation and collaboration
   within digital supply chains. Additionally, the moderating effect of
   customer involvement positively influences the relationship between the
   digital supply chain and ESG performance. By demonstrating these
   relations, our study contributes to theoretical and practical efforts
   toward sustainable tourism and the broader achievement of the SDGs.},

Title = {A Human-Centered Learning and Teaching Framework Using Generative
   Artificial Intelligence for Self-Regulated Learning Development Through
   Domain Knowledge Learning in K-12 Settings},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {1588-1599},
Abstract = {The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited an
   increase in discussions about generative AI tools in education. In this
   study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses
   generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through
   domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in
   educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools
   can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of
   teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the
   evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful
   facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated
   instructions and attempt to develop students' individualized learning.
   Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students
   to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate
   active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage
   self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers
   equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their
   teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges.
   The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case
   study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability
   among primary students within a K-12 educational context. This article
   also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers.
   Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of
   the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative
   AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and
   increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that
   would enhance students' attention, engagement, confidence, and
   satisfaction.},

   similar effects studying the release of other image-based generative AI

Abstract = {Introduction: The concept of Digital Twins (DTs) translated to drug
   development and clinical trials describes virtual representations of
   systems of various complexities, ranging from individual cells to entire
   humans, and enables in silico simulations and experiments. DTs increase
   the efficiency of drug discovery and development by digitalizing
   processes associated with high economic, ethical, or social burden. The
   impact is multifaceted: DT models sharpen disease understanding, support
   biomarker discovery and accelerate drug development, thus advancing
   precision medicine. One way to realize DTs is by generative artificial
   intelligence (AI), a cutting-edge technology that enables the creation
   of novel, realistic and complex data with desired properties.Areas
   covered: The authors provide a brief introduction to generative AI and
   describe how it facilitates the modeling of DTs. In addition, they
   compare existing implementations of generative AI for DTs in drug
   discovery and clinical trials. Finally, they discuss technical and
   regulatory challenges that should be addressed before DTs can transform
   drug discovery and clinical trials.Expert opinion: The current state of
   DTs in drug discovery and clinical trials does not exploit the entire
   power of generative AI yet and is limited to simulation of a small
   number of characteristics. Nonetheless, generative AI has the potential
   to transform the field by leveraging recent developments in deep
   learning and customizing models for the needs of scientists, physicians
   and patients.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {There are two main ways to discover or design small drug molecules. The
   first involves fine-tuning existing molecules or commercially successful
   drugs through quantitative structure-activity relationships and virtual
   screening. The second approach involves generating new molecules through
   de novo drug design or inverse quantitative structure-activity
   relationship. Both methods aim to get a drug molecule with the best
   pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. However, bringing a new
   drug to market is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor, with the
   average cost being estimated at around \$2.5 billion. One of the biggest
   challenges is screening the vast number of potential drug candidates to
   find one that is both safe and effective. The development of artificial
   intelligence in recent years has been phenomenal, ushering in a
   revolution in many fields. The field of pharmaceutical sciences has also
   significantly benefited from multiple applications of artificial
   intelligence, especially drug discovery projects. Artificial
   intelligence models are finding use in molecular property prediction,
   molecule generation, virtual screening, synthesis planning, repurposing,
   among others. Lately, generative artificial intelligence has gained
   popularity across domains for its ability to generate entirely new data,
   such as images, sentences, audios, videos, novel chemical molecules,
   etc. Generative artificial intelligence has also delivered promising
   results in drug discovery and development. This review article delves
   into the fundamentals and framework of various generative artificial
   intelligence models in the context of drug discovery via de novo drug
   design approach. Various basic and advanced models have been discussed,
   along with their recent applications. The review also explores recent
   examples and advances in the generative artificial intelligence
   approach, as well as the challenges and ongoing efforts to fully harness
   the potential of generative artificial intelligence in generating novel
   drug molecules in a faster and more affordable manner. Some
   clinical-level assets generated form generative artificial intelligence
   have also been discussed in this review to show the ever-increasing
   application of artificial intelligence in drug discovery through

   Generative Artificial Intelligence on Psychotherapy},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {This paper explores a significant shift in the field of mental health in
   general and psychotherapy in particular following generative artificial
   intelligence's new capabilities in processing and generating humanlike
   language. Following Freud, this lingo-technological development is
   conceptualized as the ``fourth narcissistic blow{''} that science
   inflicts on humanity. We argue that this narcissistic blow has a
   potentially dramatic influence on perceptions of human society,
   interrelationships, and the self. We should, accordingly, expect
   dramatic changes in perceptions of the therapeutic act following the
   emergence of what we term the artificial third in the field of
   psychotherapy. The introduction of an artificial third marks a critical
   juncture, prompting us to ask the following important core questions
   that address two basic elements of critical thinking, namely,
   transparency and autonomy: (1) What is this new artificial presence in
   therapy relationships? (2) How does it reshape our perception of
   ourselves and our interpersonal dynamics? and (3) What remains of the
   irreplaceable human elements at the core of therapy? Given the ethical
   implications that arise from these questions, this paper proposes that
   the artificial third can be a valuable asset when applied with insight
   and ethical consideration, enhancing but not replacing the human touch
   in therapy.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has gained prominence across
   various industries and domains, offering capabilities to generate
   human-like text, creative ideas, and solutions. This paper explores
   customers' responses to the use of generative AI in digitalizing content
   production and consumption processes. Drawing on technology affordance
   theory, this article examines how are the affordances of generative AI
   leveraged to contribute to the gradual digitalization of individuals.
   This netnographic study is based on over 9 months naturalistic
   observations of the AI Community online, culminating in 1572 pages of
   data. The findings identify different types of affordances that foster
   digitalization: automated content creation, automated data analysis, and
   AI-generated content dissemination. This study also identifies the
   constraints of generative AI and discusses potential interventions to
   address these constraints and prevent unintended consequences. This
   research provides insights for scholars, professionals, and educators to
   better understand the dynamics of leveraging generative AI.},

Abstract = {The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence Technology
   has increasingly drawn attention to its potential applications in the
   educational sector. This study aims to investigate the effects of
   Situational Interactive Teaching, facilitated by generative artificial
   intelligence, on students' learning outcomes and flow experiences. A
   series of experiments were designed to compare the performance of a
   Generative Artificial Intelligence-supported Situational Interactive
   Teaching Method with a Traditional Video Interactive Teaching Method.
   Data was collected using research tools such as questionnaires and test
   questions to assess students' cognitive levels, learning effectiveness,
   flow experiences, and subjective evaluations during the instructional
   process. The analysis revealed distinct differences between the two
   teaching methods. The findings suggest that compared to traditional
   teaching methods, Generative Artificial Intelligence-supported
   Situational Interactive Teaching significantly improves students'
   learning outcomes in cognitive, skill, and affective domains, while also
   enhancing flow experiences. These positive effects are not limited by
   individual student differences, indicating broad applicability.
   Furthermore, this teaching approach can foster a positive feedback loop
   between learning effectiveness and flow experience. In conclusion, this
   study confirms the effective application of generative artificial
   intelligence technology in legal education, providing empirical evidence
   for the promotion of this innovative teaching model in the educational

Journal = {EDUCATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {25},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {At the crossroads of advanced technology and pedagogy, Generative
   Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is, at the very least, prompting a
   reassessment of traditional educational paradigms. Following a frenetic
   year in the advancement of GenAI, particularly after the emergence of
   ChatGPT, there is an intent to explore the impact of GenAI on the
   educational sector, analysed from the perspectives of four key groups:
   teachers, students, decision -makers, and software engineers. Throughout
   2023 and into 2024, literature reviews, interviews, surveys, training
   sessions, and direct observations have been conducted to gauge how GenAI
   is perceived by individuals representing these groups within the
   educational context. It is highlighted how GenAI offers unprecedented
   opportunities for, among other things, personalising learning, enhancing
   the quality of educational resources, and optimising administrative and
   assessment processes. However, the application of GenAI in education
   also has a less favourable aspect related to reservations and mistrust,
   often due to a lack of literacy in issues related to AI in general, but
   also well-founded in some cases due to gaps in legislative, ethical,
   security, or environmental impact aspects. This analysis reveals that,
   although GenAI has the potential to transform education significantly,
   its successful implementation requires a collaborative and
   crosssectional approach involving all actors in the educational
   ecosystem. As we explore this new horizon, it is imperative to consider
   the ethical implications and ensure that technology is used to benefit
   society at large without overlooking the risks and challenges that
   already exist or will inevitably arise with the accelerated development
   of these extremely powerful technologies.},

Abstract = {Research SummaryStrategic decisions are uncertain and often

   for strategic decision making. We investigate the use of generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) in evaluating strategic alternatives using

   (study 2). Each study uses a sample of 60 business models and examines
   agreement in business model rankings made by large language models

   LLM roles, and prompts. We find that generative AI often produces
   evaluations that are inconsistent and biased. However, when aggregating

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to images for
   image quality enhancement, domain transfer, and augmentation of training
   data for AI modeling in various medical fields. Image-generative AI can
   produce large amounts of unannotated imaging data, which facilitates
   multiple downstream deep-learning tasks. However, their evaluation
   methods and clinical utility have not been thoroughly reviewed. This
   article summarizes commonly used generative adversarial networks and
   diffusion models. In addition, it summarizes their utility in clinical
   tasks in the field of radiology, such as direct image utilization,
   lesion detection, segmentation, and diagnosis. This article aims to
   guide readers regarding radiology practice and research using
   image-generative AI by 1) reviewing basic theories of image-generative
   AI, 2) discussing the methods used to evaluate the generated images, 3)
   outlining the clinical and research utility of generated images, and 4)
   discussing the issue of hallucinations.},

Title = {The memory systems of the human brain and generative artificial
   intelligence},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence foundation models (for example
   Generative Pre-trained Transformer - GPT - models) can generate the next
   token given a sequence of tokens. How can this `generative AI' be
   compared with the `real' intelligence of the human brain, when for
   example a human generates a whole memory in response to an incomplete
   retrieval cue, and then generates further prospective thoughts? Here
   these two types of generative intelligence, artificial in machines and
   real in the human brain are compared, and it is shown how when whole
   memories are generated by hippocampal recall in response to an
   incomplete retrieval cue, what the human brain computes, and how it
   computes it, are very different from generative AI. Key differences are
   the use of local associative learning rules in the hippocampal memory
   system, and of non-local backpropagation of error learning in AI.
   Indeed, it is argued that the whole operation of the human brain is
   performed computationally very differently to what is implemented in
   generative AI. Moreover, it is emphasized that the primate including
   human hippocampal system includes computations about spatial view and
   where objects and people are in scenes, whereas in rodents the emphasis
   is on place cells and path integration by movements between places. This
   comparison with generative memory and processing in the human brain has
   interesting implications for the further development of generative AI
   and for neuroscience research.},

   how user motivations for ChatGPT usage affect perceived creepiness,
   trust, and the intention to continue using AI chatbot technology. The
   findings of an online survey (N = 421) reveal a negative relationship
   between personalization and creepiness, while task efficiency and social
   interaction are positively associated with creepiness. Increased levels
   of creepiness, in turn, result in decreased continuance intention.
   Furthermore, task efficiency and personalization have a positive impact
   on trust, leading to increased continuance intention. The results
   contribute to the field of human-computer interaction by investigating
   the motivations for utilizing generative AI chatbots and advancing our
   comprehension of AI creepiness, trust, and continuance intention. The

   based on training data. Compared to conversational artificial
   intelligence, generative artificial intelligence systems have the unique
   capability of not only providing replies but also generating the content
   of those responses. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence
   during the Fourth Industrial Revolution, exemplified by tools like
   ChatGPT, have gained popularity and reshaped content production and
   creation. However, the benefits of generative artificial intelligence
   are not equally accessible to all, especially in developing countries,
   where limited access to cutting-edge technologies and inadequate
   infrastructure pose challenges. This paper seeks to understand the
   potential impact of generative AI technologies on developing countries,
   considering economic growth, access to technology, and the potential
   paradigm shift in education, healthcare, and the environment. The
   findings emphasize the importance of providing the necessary support and

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) applications, such as ChatGPT
   (Chat Generative Pre -trained Transformer) and Midjourney, have recently
   attracted much attention from researchers and school teachers. While
   many people are eager to learn more about GAI applications, some
   scholars are concerned about the potential misuse of them. It is
   predicted that the use of GAI applications will increase rapidly in the
   coming years. Therefore, it is important to consider the challenges and
   research issues through some concrete application examples of using GAI
   for education. In this position paper, the authors aim to address these
   issues from the perspectives of academic research and educational
   objectives. Along with defining GAI, several illustrative examples of
   using GAI applications in educational settings are provided. Moreover,
   potential research issues of GAI-based learning, including research
   design, relevant learning strategies, research focus, and measuring
   tools, are discussed. ET\&S journal is especially welcoming research on
   unlocking the potential of GAI for education to realize the two notions
   of ``Knowing {[}why] is the essential element for learners to have
   in-depth understanding{''} and ``It is all about prompts: Get rid of the
   `search' mindset and use `programming prompt' instead.{''}},

   the generative AI academic research in the past decade using
   bibliometrics, text analysis, and social network analysis. Specifically,
   research themes and their relationships, the evolution of research
   themes over time, and prominent authors, articles, journals,
   institutions, and countries publishing in generative AI are identified.
   The data was further found to partially support the classical
   bibliometrics laws of Zipf, and Bradford's. The two overarching research
   themes identified using knowledge synthesis from most cited articles and
   journals are technical advancements and developments in generative AI
   systems; and their applications to image processing, pattern
   recognition, and computer vision. ChatGPT, large language models, and
   the application of generative AI to healthcare and education are

Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), characterized by its ability to
   generate diverse forms of content including text, images, video and
   audio, has revolutionized many fields, including medical education.
   Generative AI leverages machine learning to create diverse content,
   enabling personalized learning, enhancing resource accessibility, and
   facilitating interactive case studies. This narrative review explores
   the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into
   orthopedic education and training, highlighting its potential, current
   challenges, and future trajectory. A review of recent literature was
   conducted to evaluate the current applications, identify potential
   benefits, and outline limitations of integrating generative AI in
   orthopedic education. Key findings indicate that generative AI holds
   substantial promise in enhancing orthopedic training through its various
   applications such as providing real-time explanations, adaptive learning
   materials tailored to individual student's specific needs, and immersive
   virtual simulations. However, despite its potential, the integration of
   generative AI into orthopedic education faces significant issues such as
   accuracy, bias, inconsistent outputs, ethical and regulatory concerns
   and the critical need for human oversight. Although generative AI models
   such as ChatGPT and others have shown impressive capabilities, their
   current performance on orthopedic exams remains suboptimal, highlighting
   the need for further development to match the complexity of clinical
   reasoning and knowledge application. Future research should focus on
   addressing these challenges through ongoing research, optimizing
   generative AI models for medical content, exploring best practices for
   ethical AI usage, curriculum integration and evaluating the long-term
   impact of these technologies on learning outcomes. By expanding AI's
   knowledge base, refining its ability to interpret clinical images, and
   ensuring reliable, unbiased outputs, generative AI holds the potential
   to revolutionize orthopedic education. This work aims to provides a
   framework for incorporating generative AI into orthopedic curricula to
   create a more effective, engaging, and adaptive learning environment for
   future orthopedic practitioners.},

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of utilizing generative artificial
   intelligence optimizations in automating the content generation process.
   This instance involves the identification of fraudulent content, which
   is often characterized by dynamic patterns, in addition to content
   production. The generated contents are constrained, which limits their
   dimensionality. In this scenario, duplicated contents are eliminated
   from the automatic creations. Furthermore, the generated ratios are
   utilized to discover current patterns with minimized losses and errors,
   hence enhancing the accuracy of generative contents. Furthermore, while
   analysing the created patterns, we detect a significant discrepancy in
   lead durations, resulting in the generation of high scores for relevant
   information. In order to test the results using generative tools, the
   adversarial network codes are employed in four scenarios. These
   scenarios involve generating large patterns and reducing the dynamic
   patterns with an enhanced accuracy of 97\% in the projected model. This
   is in contrast to the existing approach, which only provides a content
   accuracy of 77\% after detecting fraud.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to

   the word cloud, a toolkit often used to scaffold teaching and learning
   for reflection, critical thinking, and content learning. Addressing the
   issues in traditional word clouds, semantic word clouds have been
   developed but they are technically challenging to develop and still
   problematic. However, generative AI has the potential to develop
   efficient, accurate, creative, and accessible word clouds. Three
   different methods representing three major approaches of word cloud
   generation were developed, implemented, and user evaluated-traditional
   (baseline), semantic (natural language processing enhanced), and
   generative AI (generative pretrained transformer based)-in two different
   language contexts-Chinese (China case) and English (Singapore case). The
   findings of the study show the technical robustness of the methods, as
   well as provide key pedagogical insights from the user perspective of
   instructors of higher education courses in China and Singapore.

Abstract = {This article focuses on copyright issues pertaining to generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) systems, with particular emphasis on the
   ChatGPT case study as a primary exemplar. In order to generate
   high-quality outcomes, generative AI systems require substantial
   quantities of training data, which may frequently comprise
   copyright-protected information. This prompts inquiries into the legal
   principles of fair use, the creation of derivative works and the
   lawfulness of data gathering and utilisation. The utilisation of input
   data for the purpose of training and enhancing AI models presents
   significant concerns regarding potential violations of copyright. This
   paper offers suggestions for safeguarding the interests of copyright
   holders and competitors, while simultaneously addressing legal
   challenges and expediting the advancement of AI technologies. This study
   analyses the ChatGPT platform as a case example to explore the necessary
   modifications that copyright regulations must undergo to adequately
   tackle the intricacies of authorship and ownership in the realm of
   AI-generated creative content.},

   first to identify key enablers for the successful integration of Gen-AI
   into the supply chain with the help of Delphi and AHP techniques. Then,
   we screened these enablers categories and identified seven key enabler
   categories using the Delphi method. We computed the weights of those
   categories and ranked them on the basis of their weights with Ethical
   and Fair AI Practices and Public Trust and Societal Impact among the
   most significant. Second, this study categorised the tweet into
   positive, neutral, and negative sentiments using sentiment analysis and

Abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT
   has sparked significant assessment concerns within tertiary education.
   Assessment concerns have largely revolved around academic integrity
   issues among students, such as plagiarism and cheating. Nonetheless, it
   is also critical to consider that generative AI models trained on
   information retrieved from the Internet could produce biased and
   discriminatory outputs, and hallucination issues in large language
   models upon which generative AI acts provide made-up and untruthful

   illustrates considerations for assessment redesign with the existence of
   generative AI and proposes the Against, Avoid and Adopt (AAA) principle
   to rethink and redesign assessments. It argues that more generative AI

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly
   transforming multiple sectors, with significant potential to
   revolutionise nursing through advancements in education, practice, and
   research. However, the application of generative AI in nursing remains
   underexplored, highlighting the need for a comprehensive review of its
   current impact and future implications. Aim: To investigate the current
   state and implications of generative AI in nursing education, practice,
   and research. Methods: This scoping review was conducted following the
   methodological frameworks of Arksey and O'Malley, refined by Levac and
   colleagues. The databases searched for articles published between
   January 2020 and April 2024 included PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO,
   Cochrane Library, and IEEE Xplore. Findings: A total of 4858 articles
   were identified, with 23 included in this review. Most of the selected
   studies were published in 2024 (n = 19/23), primarily conducted in the
   United States (n = 8/23), and largely consisted of quantitative
   descriptive studies (n = 14/22). ChatGPT was the most frequently used
   tool, appearing in 95.7\% of the studies (n = 22/23). The articles
   addressed various nursing domains, including nursing education (n =
   12/23), practice (n = 10/23), and research (n = 1/23). Both the benefits
   and concerns associated with this technology were identified.
   Discussion: Generative AI shows great promise for transforming nursing
   education, practice, and research; however, its integration is still in
   the early stages. Conclusion: To fully leverage the benefits of
   generative AI, nursing professionals must address the challenges
   associated with AI and lead its ethical adoption. Rigorous research and
   proactive leadership are crucial to realising the potential of
   generative AI in nursing. (c) 2024 Australian College of Nursing Ltd.

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI), a subset of machine learning
   that creates new content based on training data, has witnessed
   tremendous advances in recent years. Practical applications have been
   identified in health care in general, and there is significant
   opportunity in transplant medicine for generative AI to simplify tasks
   in research, medical education, and clinical practice. In addition,
   patients stand to benefit from patient education that is more readily
   provided by generative AI applications. This review aims to catalyze the
   development and adoption of generative AI in transplantation by
   introducing basic AI and generative AI concepts to the transplant
   clinician and summarizing its current and potential applications within
   the field. We provide an overview of applications to the clinician,
   researcher, educator, and patient. We also highlight the challenges
   involved in bringing these applications to the bedside and need for
   ongoing refinement of generative AI applications to sustainably augment
   the transplantation field.},

Abstract = {ChatGPT, an interactive, generative artificial intelligence (AI) system,
   was introduced in late 2022, quickly becoming one of the most rapidly
   adopted technologies in history. The rapid emergence of ChatGPT and
   similar AI tools, such as Google's Bard, and GPT-enabled Bing from
   Microsoft have led to intense discussions about how they will affect
   various aspects of society, including higher education. Information
   systems (IS) education will not escape the impact of AI tools. Our goal
   for this paper is to develop a better understanding of the range of
   possible impacts of ChatGPT on IS education and to describe how IS
   educators might respond to these potential impacts. To that end, we
   discuss challenges for IS education brought on by generative AI tools,
   and discuss potential future scenarios based on the emergence of such
   tools, ranging from AI having little impact on IS education to AI
   serving as competition for IS educators. We examine the challenges and
   consequences of each scenario. We also discuss potential responses,
   ranging from doing nothing to embracing AI tools as legitimate learning
   aids. We then provide several specific recommendations that will allow
   IS educators to effectively respond to the rise of AI tools.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study reviews the recent progress of generative artificial
   intelligence for gastrointestinal disease (GID) from detection to
   diagnosis. The source of data was 16 original studies in PubMed. The
   search terms were ((gastro{*} {[}title]) or (endo{*} {[}title])) and
   ((GAN {[}title/abstract] or (transformer {[}title/abstract]). The
   eligibility criteria were as follows: (1) the dependent variable of
   gastrointestinal disease; (2) the interventions of generative
   adversarial network (GAN) and/or transformer for classification,
   detection and/or segmentation; (3) the outcomes of accuracy,
   intersection of union (IOU), structural similarity and/or Dice; (3) the
   publication period of 2021-2023; (4) the publication language of
   English. Based on the results of this study, different generative
   artificial intelligence methods would be appropriate for different tasks
   for the early diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease. For example, patch
   GAN (accuracy 91.9\%) in the case of classification, bi-directional
   cycle GAN (structural similarity 98.8\%) in the case of data generation
   and semi-supervised GAN (Dice 89.4\%) in the case of segmentation. Their
   performance indicators reported varied within 87.1-91.9\% for accuracy,
   83.0-98.8\% for structural similarity and 86.6-89.4\% for Dice.
   Likewise, vision transformer (accuracy 96.9\%) in the case of
   classification, multi-modal transformer (IOU 79.5\%) in the case of
   detection and multi-modal transformer (Dice 89.5\%) in the case of
   segmentation. Their performance measures reported registered a variation
   within 85.7-96.9\% for accuracy, 79.5\% for IOU and 77.8-89.5\% for
   Dice. Synthesizing different kinds of generative artificial intelligence
   for different kinds of GID data would further the horizon of research on
   this topic. In conclusion, however, generative artificial intelligence
   provides an effective, non-invasive decision support system for the
   early diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease from detection to diagnosis.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe principle of transparency is of great significance in the
   governance of text-based generative artificial intelligence (AI)
   technology. The principle of transparency not only requires the
   operational principles and algorithms of text-based generative
   artificial intelligence to be interpretable, but also requires
   text-based generative artificial intelligence programs to fulfill basic
   prompting obligations to users, especially when it comes to the output
   content of generative artificial intelligence, which cannot guarantee
   true and accurate prompts.AimsThe purpose of this study is to explore
   the classification and frequency of prompt methods in text-based
   generative artificial intelligence and to propose that laws should
   require different prompt rules for various user categories, addressing
   the current gap in existing regulations.MethodsThe experiment is
   conducted from June 1 to 15, 2024 in the school, scientific research
   company, media organization hall, and railway station lounge, and Kimi
   program, Tongyi program, ERNIE Bot program, iFLYTEK Spark program, etc.,
   are used as text-based generative AI programs.DiscussionThe results show
   that users aged 8-17 who are minors only have 6 points in their
   perception of the authenticity of the output content of generative
   artificial intelligence programs; the level of awareness of possible
   falsity during use reaches 4 points; the degree of user misleading is as
   high as 13 points.ConclusionThe study concludes that, for individuals
   needing special protection, such as minors, prompts should accompany
   every instance of content generation. For other user groups, prompts
   should be issued when necessary. To enhance prompt effectiveness, the
   program should display permanent prompts in prominent positions on the
   interface, using noticeable fonts and clear, well-designed wording.
   Research reveals that minors have insufficient perception of the
   authenticity of the output content of generative artificial
   intelligence, and the risk of misleading is significant, highlighting
   the importance of clear prompts for this specific group every time they
   generate content.},

Abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence, such as large
   language models and text-to-image models, has had a profound impact on
   society. The ability of these systems to simulate human capabilities
   such as text writing and image creation is radically redefining a wide
   range of practices, from artistic production to education. While there
   is no doubt that these innovations are beneficial to our lives, the
   pervasiveness of these technologies should not be underestimated, and
   raising increasingly pressing ethical questions that require a radical
   resemantization of certain notions traditionally ascribed to humans
   alone. Among these notions, that of technological intentionality plays a
   central role. With regard to this notion, this paper first aims to
   highlight what we propose to define in terms of the intentionality gap,
   whereby, insofar as, currently, (1) it is increasingly difficult to
   assign responsibility for the actions performed by AI systems to humans,
   as these systems are increasingly autonomous, and (2) it is increasingly
   complex to reconstruct the reasoning behind the results they produce as
   we move away from good old fashioned AI; it is now even more difficult
   to trace the intentionality of AI systems back to the intentions of the
   developers and end users. This gap between human and technological
   intentionality requires a revision of the concept of intentionality; to
   this end, we propose here to assign preter-intentional behavior to
   generative AI. We use this term to highlight how AI intentionality both
   incorporates and transcends human intentionality; i.e., it goes beyond
   (preter) human intentionality while being linked to it. To show the
   merits of this notion, we first rule out the possibility that such
   preter-intentionality is merely an unintended consequence and then
   explore its nature by comparing it with some paradigmatic notions of

Abstract = {Social work scholars have long questioned the validity and utility of

   explore the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as
   ChatGPT to address core problems of the ASWB exams, including the use of
   a multiple-choice format that does not reflect real-world social work
   practice. To assess its social work reasoning, we used ChatGPT to answer
   ASWB-developed practice questions for the Bachelors, Masters, and
   Clinical exams. ChatGPT scored 76\%, 80\%, and 64\%, respectively, and
   identified additional validity challenges. Based on this performance, we
   provide a proof-of-concept for how generative AI might move us toward a
   more valid and equitable exam. While we strongly support licensure
   requirements, state regulators and legislators should temporarily
   suspend the use of the ASWB exams for this purpose.},

Journal = {ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {251},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent years, there have been unparalleled prospects for
   psychological study due to the swift advancement of generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) in natural language processing, shown by
   ChatGPT. This review article looks into the uses and effects of
   generative artificial intelligence in psychology. We employed a
   systematic selection process, encompassing papers published between 2015
   and 2024 from databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore,
   using keywords like ``Generative AI in psychology{''} ``ChatGPT and
   behavior modeling{''} and ``AI in mental health{''}. First, the paper
   goes over the fundamental ideas of generative AI and lists its uses in
   data analysis, behavior modeling, and social interaction simulation. A
   detailed comparison table has been added to contrast conventional
   research methodologies with GenAI-based approaches in psychology
   studies. Next, analyzing the theoretical and ethical issues that
   generative AI raises for psychological research, it highlights how
   crucial it is to develop a coherent theoretical framework. This study
   illustrates the benefits of generative AI in handling vast amounts of
   data and increasing research efficiency by contrasting traditional
   research methods with AI-driven methodologies. Regarding particular
   uses, the study explores how generative AI might be used to simulate
   social interactions, analyze massive amounts of text, and learn about
   cognitive processes. Section 5 has been expanded to include discussions
   on political biases, geographic biases, and other biases. In conclusion,
   the paper looks forward to the future development of generative AI in
   psychology research and suggests techniques for improving it. We have
   included methodological solutions such as the Retrieval Augmented
   Generation (RAG) approach and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as data
   privacy solutions like open-source local LLMs. In summary, generative AI
   has the potential to revolutionize psychological research, but in order
   to maintain the moral and scientific integrity of the field, ethical and
   theoretical concerns must be carefully considered before applying the
   technology.},

Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has fundamentally transformed
   the education landscape, offering unprecedented potential for
   personalized learning and enhanced teaching methods. This research
   conducted two sub-studies aimed at exploring the influences and
   differences in college students' attitudes towards generative artificial
   intelligence across the dimensions of gender, major, and experience. The
   first sub-study developed a scale based on the Expectancy-Value Theory
   to measure college students' attitudes towards generative artificial
   intelligence, confirming the scale's validity and reliability. The
   second sub-study analyzed attitudes towards generative artificial
   intelligence among 713 undergraduate students. The results revealed
   significant differences in undergraduate students' attitudes towards
   generative artificial intelligence based on gender, major, and
   experience. Female students and those with experience in generative
   artificial intelligence showed more positive attitudes compared to male
   students and those without generative artificial intelligence
   experience. Notably, students majoring in Education scored significantly
   higher on generative artificial intelligence attitudes than students
   from other majors. Regression analysis further indicated that gender,
   discipline, and experience significantly predicted attitudes towards
   generative artificial intelligence. Students from different academic
   backgrounds exhibited significant gender and experience differences in
   their attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence within their
   respective majors. These findings underscore the necessity for
   educational strategies that consider gender, experience, and
   disciplinary backgrounds. It is crucial to provide all students with
   ample opportunities to engage with generative artificial intelligence to
   ensure gender equity in artificial intelligence education. Educators
   must design differentiated and inclusive generative artificial
   intelligence education activities and strategies tailored to specific
   disciplines to meet diverse student needs and accommodate disciplinary
   variations. This study aims to provide insightful perspectives for
   assessing college students' attitudes towards generative artificial

Title = {An empirical study of factors influencing usage intention for generative
   artificial intelligence products: A case study of China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 1},
Abstract = {The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technologies
   has sparked widespread interest, yet understanding of user adoption
   patterns for these tools remains limited. While the unified theory of
   acceptance and use of technology model has been widely applied to
   various technologies, its applicability to generative artificial
   intelligence products, which present unique challenges and
   opportunities, has not been thoroughly explored. This gap in knowledge
   hinders the development of effective strategies for promoting user
   acceptance and optimising the design of generative artificial
   intelligence tools. This study extends the unified theory of acceptance
   and use of technology model to investigate the factors influencing usage
   intention for generative artificial intelligence products. The study
   incorporates additional variables such as digital literacy, perceived
   risk and perceived trust to provide a more comprehensive framework.
   Using structural equation modelling to analyse survey data, the study
   found that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence,
   and perceived trust significantly and positively impact usage intention.
   In addition, digital literacy indirectly enhances usage intention
   through effort expectancy, while perceived risk negatively influences
   usage intention through reduced trust. Notably, facilitating conditions
   did not exhibit a significant effect on usage intention. These findings
   offer valuable insights for developers and researchers in the field of
   generative artificial intelligence, highlighting the importance of
   user-friendly design, performance optimisation, and trust-building
   measures. By identifying key factors that drive user adoption, this
   study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of technology
   acceptance in the context of advanced artificial intelligence systems,
   paving the way for more effective development and implementation
   strategies in this rapidly evolving field.},

Title = {Assessing EFL learners' attitudes on Generative Artificial Intelligence:
   Development and validation of Generative Artificial Intelligence
   attitude scale for EFL learners (GenAIAS)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 2},
Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a
   transformative force in education, particularly in the context of
   English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instruction. This study aims to
   develop and validate the Generative Artificial Intelligence Attitude
   Scale (GenAIAS) to assess EFL learners' attitudes toward GenAI. The
   research involved two independent samples of university students in T \&
   uuml;rkiye, with data collected through scales and analyzed using
   exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The final scale,
   comprising 33 items, was categorized into four factors:
   Learning/Utility, Enjoyment, Usefulness, and Interest. The scale
   demonstrated good psychometric properties, including satisfactory
   convergent and discriminant validity, internal consistency, and
   measurement invariance across genders. The findings indicate no
   significant gender differences in attitudes toward GenAI, suggesting a
   general acceptance of GenAI technologies among EFL learners.
   Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between daily internet
   usage and attitudes toward GenAI. This study contributes to the growing
   body of knowledge on GenAI in language education and offers practical
   implications for integrating GenAI into language learning, highlighting
   the importance of fostering positive attitudes for successful technology
   adoption. Future research should further validate the scale with diverse
   populations to enhance its reliability and applicability.},

   exploratory, using a qualitative approach and two data collection
   techniques, namely bibliographic research and observation. Result:
   Generative AI tools bring new opportunities and challenges to academia
   and raise concerns about copyright (plagiarism and intellectual property
   of the content generated by the technology), integrity of science,
   reliability of research, fairness and ethics (dissemination of bias) and

Abstract = {Molecular generative artificial intelligence is
   drawingsignificantattention in the drug design community, with several
   experimentallyvalidated proof of concepts already published.
   Nevertheless, generativemodels are known for sometimes generating
   unrealistic, unstable, unsynthesizable,or uninteresting structures. This
   calls for methods to constrain thosealgorithms to generate structures in
   drug-like portions of the chemicalspace. While the concept of
   applicability domains for predictive modelsis well studied, its
   counterpart for generative models is not yetwell-defined. In this work,
   we empirically examine various possibilitiesand propose applicability
   domains suited for generative models. Usingboth public and internal data
   sets, we use generative methods to generatenovel structures that are
   predicted to be actives by a correspondingquantitative
   structure-activity relationships model while constrainingthe generative
   model to stay within a given applicability domain.Our work looks at
   several applicability domain definitions, combiningvarious criteria,
   such as structural similarity to the training set,similarity of
   physicochemical properties, unwanted substructures,and quantitative
   estimate of drug-likeness. We assess the structuresgenerated from both
   qualitative and quantitative points of view andfind that the
   applicability domain definitions have a strong influenceon the
   drug-likeness of generated molecules. An extensive analysisof our
   results allows us to identify applicability domain definitionsthat are
   best suited for generating drug-like molecules with generativemodels. We
   anticipate that this work will help foster the adoptionof generative
   models in an industrial context.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to critically review the effect of
   generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools on higher education and
   research in the tourism and hospitality (TH) field. This manuscript
   identifies capabilities and implications of these GAI applications
   through a theoretical lens. GAI adoption in TH education can facilitate
   personalized learning experiences, enhance the technological competence
   of students, and foster a more diverse and inclusive learning
   environment. For academic research, GAI-enabled technologies may
   revolutionize data collection, analysis, and writing in a myriad of
   ways. However, there are multiple ethical and legal concerns associated
   with adoption that must be considered. At the end of this paper, we
   propose ten discussion questions aimed at stimulating conversation about
   adoption of GAI tools in TH education and research.},

Title = {GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VS HUMANS IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING
   CORPORATE IDENTITY ELEMENTS},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {6},
Pages = {212-230},
Abstract = {The emergence of new tools, the appearance of new technologies and
   improvements to existing ones have resulted in expansion of generative
   artificial intelligence. The technologies of generative artificial
   intelligence have already been used by people to perform not only
   intellectual tasks, but also creative ones, in particular in the field
   of design. Therefore, their capabilities in graphic design need to be
   studied. One of the routine tasks of a designer is the development of
   corporate identity elements (a logo, font, and colour). Designers can
   spend a lot of time on this, choosing different style options.
   Therefore, delegating this routine work to generative artificial
   intelligence may be appropriate. With this practical need in mind, the
   capabilities of modern AI tools for image and logo generation were
   studied in the research, and the results of AI logo generation compared
   to the work of novice designers were analysed. As a result, conclusions
   were drawn about the expediency of using generative AI technology in the
   work of designers, in particular, for the development of corporate
   identity elements, and the appropriateness of studying generative
   artificial intelligence technology in the training of future designers.
   These conclusions were made on the basis of a survey of 41 experts in
   the field of design, information technology and artificial intelligence.
   Based on the findings of the survey, we can note that it was difficult
   for experts to distinguish between logos generated by artificial
   intelligence and logos created by novice designers. Logos developed by
   novice designers (5) were recognized as the most attractive among the 45
   logos presented in the survey. Images generated in some AI tools (Tailor
   Brands, Hatchful) are considered attractive by design, information
   technology and artificial intelligence professionals. Therefore, they
   can be used to create corporate identity elements. Thus, the vast
   majority of experts agreed that artificial intelligence tools for
   generating images and logos should be used in the process of creating
   corporate identity elements. In addition, the vast majority of experts
   found it advisable to use generative artificial intelligence
   technologies in the process of professional training of future
   designers.},

   make their way into clinical practice, research, and education.
   Chatbots, which can generate human-like responses, have gained attention
   for their potential applications. Therefore, familiarity with LLMs and
   other promising generative AI tools is crucial to harness their
   potential safely and effectively. As these AI-based technologies
   continue to evolve, medical professionals must develop a strong

Abstract = {In this article, we employ the prism of technological acceleration to
   consider how Generative AI may impact the spatial-temporal dimensions of
   diplomacy, and what ramifications this transformation may hold for its
   practice. To do so, we distinguish between Horizontal Acceleration,
   which relates to the number of diplomatic domains that are progressively
   impacted by the introduction of a new digital technology, and Vertical
   Acceleration, which relates to how ripple effects reverberate within the
   diplomatic domain and how deeply. Next, we outline three possible
   scenarios in which Generative AI leads to minimal or maximal horizontal
   and vertical acceleration. In the Dedalus scenario, Generative AI's
   impact is confined to a few domains, predominantly influencing
   diplomats' daily routines. In the Heracles scenario, Generative AI
   systems interact with one another rendering human diplomats as mere
   messengers. We coin this outcome as `the end of diplomacy.' Finally, we
   anticipate that many MFAs may position themselves between these two
   poles in the Pygmalion scenario.},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to offer an analytical perspective to
   understand and situate in their specific dimension the different debates

   traits of AI: they are not a technology, but rather meta-technologies;
   They constitute not a technical device, but a world-environment; They
   can be high-risk technologies and require appropriate treatment in their
   life cycle; Generative AI and in particular LLM are not only Artificial
   Intelligence, but also Artificial Society; The perspective of AI ethics
   is not sufficient to address them and it is necessary to promote an
   approach from the organizational ethics of AI and from systemic
   thinking. Secondly, we cut out the different scales at which AI is
   currently developed: the micro scale, the meso scale (the most suitable
   for situating public policies) and the macro scale. Thirdly, we present
   two transversal approaches to addressing AI: the legal one, oriented
   towards responsibility, and the systemic one, oriented towards

Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {While generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for many
   years, it has only recently become available for use by the public. This
   powerful resource has changed the landscape for higher education and
   many instructors fear the negative effects it can have on academic
   integrity and student creativity in the writing process. However, it is
   certain that AI is here to stay, and it is crucial that educators
   embrace this technology and teach students to use this resource
   carefully and wisely. Communication is an essential component in nursing
   practice and cultivating competent writing skills is a vital aspect of
   nursing education. However, nursing students struggle with scholarly
   writing especially at the undergraduate level. Integrating generative
   artificial intelligence into a writing intensive course offers a unique
   approach to aid students in improving their writing. In this pilot
   project, students were given an assignment to actively engage with
   generative artificial intelligence and critically analyze the response
   using current nursing literature to support or refute the output. This
   assignment was used to springboard class discussion on advantages and
   disadvantages of using artificial intelligence for scholarly writing.
   This novel approach has the potential to build confidence and competence
   in novice writers which supports their success in nursing school and in

Year = {2025},
Volume = {43},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As technology continues to transform education, the adoption of
   generative artificial intelligence is increasing in nursing education.
   However, concerns regarding the accuracy of AI-generated content and
   ethical issues exist. This study explores the perceptions/experiences of
   nurse educators in South Korea regarding the use of generative
   artificial intelligence. Using a cross-sectional survey, data were
   gathered from 120 nurse educators, and descriptive statistical analysis
   was applied to the data. Significantly 38.9\% of participants reported
   no prior engagement with generative artificial intelligence. Meanwhile,
   32.5\% identified ChatGPT as their preferred source. The perceived
   usefulness of generative artificial intelligence was evaluated on
   average as 3.11 (SD = 0.31) on a 4-point scale, suggesting a generally
   favorable view of its potential to diversify learning resources, enhance
   student learning experiences, and improve educational quality. Despite
   these positive perceptions, the average engagement score with generative
   artificial intelligence was 2.76 (SD = 0.40), reflecting moderate actual
   use. This study contributes to the literature on generative artificial
   intelligence integration in education, revealing an overall positive
   attitude among nurse educators. It underscores the need for increased
   application and familiarity with such technologies to maximize teaching
   strategy benefits, student outcomes, and the efficacy of nursing
   education.},

Abstract = {As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as
   ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the
   social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will
   be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it
   is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which
   constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW)
   hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking
   metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy.
   There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence:
   a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The
   combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works
   by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from
   information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The
   parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning
   (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by
   analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the
   data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal
   development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative
   framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD
   generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as
   not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.},

   In-Depth Learning},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {This study examines how generative AI (GAI) impacts primary students'
   in-depth learning, focusing on critical thinking and prior knowledge. A
   quasi-experiment involved 163 sixth-graders divided into three groups: a
   control group (lecture-based instruction) and two experimental groups
   using GAI as a cognitive tool (materials generation) or thinking tool
   (critical analysis), in which 126 participants successfully completed
   all the tests and were included in the analysis. ANOVA revealed the
   thinking-tool group and cognitive-tool group both outperformed the
   control group in in-depth learning, which was reflected by the knowledge
   transfer. Hierarchical regression showed students' critical thinking
   skills and use of generative artificial intelligence significantly
   contributed to their in-depth learning, while prior knowledge did not.
   Further analysis found that significant interaction effects existed
   between the use of generative artificial intelligence and critical
   thinking skills, while no significant interaction was found between the
   use of generative artificial intelligence and students' prior knowledge.
   In sum, critical thinking amplified GAI's impact, while prior knowledge
   showed no interaction. The results suggest GAI enhances deep learning
   when integrated with critical thinking, reducing reliance on prior
   knowledge. Educators should prioritize fostering critical thinking to
   maximize GAI's benefits. The findings underscore the need for
   pedagogical designs that balance GAI's cognitive support with

Abstract = {In this article, we reflect on the dark side of generative artificial
   intelligence. We identify several concerns associated with generative
   artificial intelligence in relation to knowledge processing and
   developing understanding, including misalignment between the artificial
   intelligence's intended and actual use, its rhetorical duplicity, risk
   of technical dependence, negative impact on creativity and contextual
   understanding, overall decreased knowledge quality, the production of
   `illusory truths', artificial intelligence's progressive encapsulation
   and its exponential proliferation. We call for reflection on its
   potential implications for management learning, as well as for learning
   more broadly.},

Title = {Generative Artificial Intelligence and Extended Cognition in Science
   Learning Contexts},
Journal = {SCIENCE \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUN 11},
Abstract = {This paper philosophically examines the impact of generative artificial
   intelligence on learning processes from the perspective of extended
   cognition. The central problem addressed is how these technologies can
   transform students into passive or active learners, influencing the
   development of cognitive skills. It will be argued that generative
   artificial intelligence presents risks of diminishing cognitive activity
   among students, as it is likely to substitute-rather than complement-the
   cognitive subject. It will also be argued that there are ways to
   leverage generative artificial intelligence so that learners are not
   passive but rather active cognitive subjects. Three cases will be
   presented, with empirical support, to show how this leveraging is
   possible: the production of feedback, assistive technologies, and
   gamification. In these cases, generative artificial intelligence is a
   complementary cognitive artifact rather than a substitutive one. To
   achieve this goal, the paper presents the framework of the extended mind
   thesis as a conducive scenario for analyzing the relationship between
   generative artificial intelligence and learning contexts, and it
   analyzes specific cases of science education. An analysis of the types
   of cognitive artifacts will also be conducted to examine how generative
   artificial intelligence intervenes in learning in both substitute and
   complementary ways.},

   principles.Design and setting International online Delphi
   study.Participants International experts in medicine and artificial
   intelligence.Main outcome measures The primary outcome measure is the
   consensus level of the Delphi expert panel on the items of inclusion
   criteria for GAMER (Rreporting guideline for the use of Generative
   Artificial intelligence tools in MEdical Research).Results The
   development process included a scoping review, two Delphi rounds and
   virtual meetings. 51 experts from 26 countries participated in the
   process (44 in the Delphi survey). The final checklist comprises nine
   reporting items: general declaration, GAI tool specifications, prompting
   techniques, tool's role in the study, declaration of new GAI model(s)
   developed, artificial intelligence-assisted sections in the manuscript,
   content verification, data privacy and impact on conclusions.Conclusion
   GAMER provides universal and standardised guideline for GAI use in

Month = {APR 8},
Abstract = {The increasing reliance on artificial intelligence in cybersecurity has
   broadened the role of generative artificial intelligence in tasks such
   as text generation and translation. This study assesses the
   effectiveness of generative artificial intelligence and conventional
   translation tools in translating early vulnerability alerts from English
   to Spanish-a critical process for ensuring the timely dissemination of
   cybersecurity information. Utilizing a dataset provided by the Spanish
   National Cybersecurity Institute, translations were generated using
   various systems and evaluated through linguistic assessment metrics,
   including methods measuring lexical similarity and others capturing
   semantic meaning beyond direct word matching. Additionally, word
   embeddings were employed to enhance the accuracy of semantic similarity
   analysis. The results indicate that conventional translation tools
   generally exhibit greater accuracy and structural fidelity, whereas
   generative artificial intelligence produces more natural-sounding
   translations. However, this flexibility results in greater variability
   in translation quality. The findings suggest that while generative
   artificial intelligence may serve as a valuable complement to
   traditional tools, its inconsistencies may limit its suitability for
   highly technical content that demands precision. This study underscores
   the importance of integrating both approaches to improve the accuracy
   and accessibility of cybersecurity alerts across different languages.},

   a brief summary of the ongoing and historical developments in GAI over
   the past 70 years. The achievements are grouped into four categories:
   (i) rule-based generative systems that follow specialized rules and
   instructions, (ii) model-based generative algorithms that produce new
   content based on statistical or graphical models, (iii) deep generative
   methodologies that utilize deep neural networks to learn how to generate
   new content from data and (iv) foundation models that are trained on
   extensive datasets and capable of performing a variety of generative
   tasks. This paper also reviews successful generative applications and
   identifies open challenges posed by remaining issues. In addition, this
   paper describes potential research directions aimed at better utilizing,

   large-scale context in Chinese higher education. Results indicated that
   faculty members exhibited significant usage of generative artificial
   intelligence tools both for personal and professional purposes. They
   also used generative artificial intelligence tools for formative
   assessment practices, with limited application in summative assessments.
   Results indicated faculty faced Generative AI tool usage challenges like
   curriculum adaptation, assessment transformation, student engagement
   with generative artificial intelligence tools, ethical concerns,
   professional development, and pedagogical shifts. The findings also
   demonstrated that faculty members were struggling to address these
   challenges. Furthermore, outcomes indicated that professional
   development and ethical concerns directly, indirectly, positively and
   significantly contribute to helping faculty to enhance student
   engagement and pedagogical shifts in their teaching practices.
   Additionally, curriculum adaptation and assessment transformation have
   also mediated these relationships. These findings contribute novel
   insights into how professional development can support effective GenAI
   integration. Implications are offered for faculty development programs,
   curriculum design policies, and institutional governance in the era of
   AI-enhanced education.},

Abstract = {University students are increasingly using generative artificial
   intelligence (AI) tools in creative tasks. Drawing from the literature
   on AI-human interaction and team creativity, the present study developed
   a moderated mediating model regarding the effects of generative AI on
   team creativity. To validate the developed model, a questionnaire survey
   was conducted among 308 students from 66 collaborative groups, and the
   collected questionnaire data were analyzed through partial least squares
   structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results of this study
   indicate that the perceived intelligence of generative AI can indirectly
   promote team creativity through collective efficacy and suppress team
   creativity through task conflict. Furthermore, team trust strengthens
   the relationship between the perceived intelligence of generative AI and
   collective efficacy such that it also strengthens the indirect
   relationship between the perceived intelligence of generative AI and
   team creativity through collective efficacy. The results of this study
   have crucial theoretical implications as well as vital practical
   implications for designers of educational generative AI tools.},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of a study conducted, using both survey
   and content analysis (of the websites and fan pages) of all the

   in the repertoire of library tools, although only 39.3 \% dealt with GAI
   issues. 46 \% actively used them despite 50 \% of the libraries creating
   conditions favorable for the use of GAI. Interestingly, 43 \% of
   libraries indicated that they did not think there was a need to use GAI
   tools with the main reasons given including a lack of staff competencies
   and the appropriate regulations in the area. For those libraries using
   GAI or AI, 47 \% of them had information about this published on their
   home pages and 39 \% on their fan pages. The most common information
   found was about the promotion of AI tools, the resources available in

Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI),
   its potential applications in higher education have attracted
   significant attention. This study investigated how 148 students from
   diverse engineering disciplines and regions across China used generative
   AI, focusing on its impact on their learning experience and the
   opportunities and challenges it poses in engineering education. Based on
   the surveyed data, we explored four key areas: the frequency and
   application scenarios of AI use among engineering students, its impact
   on students' learning and performance, commonly encountered challenges
   in using generative AI, and future prospects for its adoption in
   engineering education. The results showed that more than half of the
   participants reported a positive impact of generative AI on their
   learning efficiency, initiative, and creativity, with nearly half
   believing it also enhanced their independent thinking. However, despite
   acknowledging improved study efficiency, many felt their actual academic
   performance remained largely unchanged and expressed concerns about the
   accuracy and domain-specific reliability of generative AI. Our findings
   provide a first-hand insight into the current benefits and challenges
   generative AI brings to students, particularly Chinese engineering
   students, while offering several recommendations-especially from the
   students' perspective-for effectively integrating generative AI into
   engineering education.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to identify the experiences of students on the

   method, the case study design was used in the study. The sample of the
   study included 12 last-year students in the Art Education Program of a
   state university in T \& uuml;rkiye. The implementation process took
   place within the scope of a 12-week arts major workshop course. Data
   were collected in semi-structured interviews and using reflective
   journals and analyzed using the inductive content analysis method. It
   was determined that the participants were initially prejudiced against
   generative artificial intelligence and inexperienced in using it, while
   these attitudes became more positive over time. The participants stated
   that generative artificial intelligence tools were a source of
   inspiration, offered support in composition development, and had a
   guiding role in terms of aesthetics and style. On the other hand, some
   participants reported that during the arts education process supported
   by artificial intelligence, they experienced challenges such as
   communication problems, lack of technical knowledge, and concerns about
   originality. The results of the study revealed that generative
   artificial intelligence could be utilized as an educational tool that
   could support artistic creativity and learning. Hence, it is recommended
   that elective courses supported by generative artificial intelligence be
   integrated into the curricula of programs in arts education.},

Abstract = {The authors research the criminalistic aspects of risks associated with
   the emergence and spread of a new information technology, namely,
   generative artificial intelligence used to create various information
   products quickly and effectively. The assessments of this technology are
   controversial (especially in view of its potential diverse applications)
   due to a high public danger of its application in criminal activities or
   for military purposes. The authors examine the approaches of different
   researchers to using generative artificial intelligence to commit
   crimes, present their own position regarding the possible criminal law
   qualification of such actions, and describe possible directions of
   improving the legislation. The conducted research al- lowed the authors
   to conclude that the risks of damaging public relations protected by the
   law via the use of generative artificial intelligence are mainly
   associated with computer-mediated communication. It seems that this
   technology is most often used to commit crimes through deception and
   information manipulation, such as fraud, spread of disinformation,
   involvement into extremist (including terrorist) activities, etc. It is
   facilitated by the wide possibilities of using artificial intelligence
   to create various information products: text, audio- and
   video-recordings, images, software, etc. At the same time, the work of
   generative artificial intelligence involves a specific mechanism of
   trace formation and is manifested in the forensically (primarily - diag-
   nostically) relevant features. It is possible to establish these
   features through the use of criminalistic knowledge and means. It seems
   that the most relevant current source of the resources providing
   research support for the law enforcement work is a new special

   Despite differences in personal goals and usage patterns, all
   participants showed a common shift from passive, extrinsically motivated
   learners to autonomous, intrinsically driven language users. Generative
   AI functioned not merely as a corrective tool, but as a cognitive and
   affective mediator that enhanced learners' self-evaluation, expressive

Abstract = {Technological innovation has transformed educational settings, enabling
   artificial intelligence (AI)-driven teaching and learning processes.
   While AI is still in its embryonic stage in education, generative
   artificial intelligence has evolved rapidly, significantly shifting the
   teaching and learning context. With no clarity about the impacts of
   generative artificial intelligence on education, there is a need to
   synthesise research findings to demystify generative artificial
   intelligence and address concerns regarding its application in the
   teaching and learning process. This paper systematically synthesises
   studies on generative artificial intelligence in teaching and learning
   to understand key arguments and stakeholders' perceptions of generative
   artificial intelligence in teaching and learning. The systematic review
   reveals five main domains of research within the field: (i) current
   awareness (understanding) of generative artificial intelligence, (ii)
   stakeholder perceptions, (iii) mechanisms for adopting generative
   artificial intelligence, (iv) issues and challenges of implementing
   generative artificial intelligence, and (v) contributions of generative
   artificial intelligence to student performance. This review examines the
   practical and policy implications of generative artificial intelligence,
   providing recommendations to address the concerns and challenges
   associated with generative artificial intelligence-driven teaching and
   learning processes.},

Title = {Identifying highly correlated determinants influencing student nurses'
   behavioral intention of using generative artificial intelligence
   (Generative AI): A network analysis},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {154},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Aim: This study aims to identify the most critical factors influencing
   nursing students' behavioral intention to use generative artificial
   intelligence by developing a network structure. Background: Generative
   artificial intelligence is increasingly integrated into nursing
   education and clinical nursing practice. Studies have explored the
   factors influencing behavioral intentions toward the use of Artificial
   Intelligence, but research specific to Generative Artificial
   Intelligence is still lacking. It's crucial for nursing students to use
   generative artificial intelligence effectively, especially as clinical
   environments change rapidly in the digital era. Thus, it is important to
   identify the key factors that influence their intention to use. Methods:
   A cross-sectional study was conducted. 800 participants were recruited
   from November to December 2023 through convenient sampling. Network
   analysis was applied in this study to identify the important nodes that
   are the most critical target goals for improving the behavioral
   intention of using Generative artificial intelligence by R package.
   Results: The network analysis indicated that Artificial Intelligence
   Relevance, Ethical Awareness About Artificial Intelligence served as
   central factors in the network of Generative Artificial Intelligence
   Intention of using (EI = 1.19, 1.06). Artificial Intelligence Literacy
   was a key bridge node linking the Generative Artificial Intelligence
   Intention of using with its influencing factor associations (BEI =
   0.33). Conclusions: Generative Artificial Intelligence Relevance,
   Ethical Awareness about Generative Artificial Intelligence and
   Generative Artificial Intelligence Literacy serves as potential targets
   for enhancing nursing students' behavioral intention. Nursing educators
   and universities could consider targeted and collaborative effort to
   improve their behavioral intention.},

Abstract = {In order to clarify the impact of ``generative artificial

   method based on LSTM network is proposed. In this method, learners'
   psychological needs are divided into primary psychological needs,

   which serve as input data for the deep learning process. Input data is
   then mapped into time data and keyword data, and two weight matrices are
   generated through the two dimensions of attention mechanism. By fusing
   two matrices, the final output is the satisfaction level of learners'
   psychological needs. The experimental results of deep learning show that

   summarization},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {158},
Number = {A},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Text summarization is the process of providing a concise as well as
   cohesive summary, which encapsulates the vital information from the
   original text. Although the supervised models now in use are competent,
   they frequently rely on annotated datasets and create challenges
   regarding uninterpretability and limited generalization ability. To
   overcome the limitations, this research proposes a Generative Artificial
   Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder
   Representations from the Transformers model to generate concise
   summaries. During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes
   into account data from various segments of the input sequence by
   utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique.
   Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing
   grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global
   Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output
   summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate
   summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy.
   Furthermore, the experimental outcomes show that the Generative
   Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder
   Representations from the Transformers model surpasses the conventional
   text summarization techniques concerning Bilingual Evaluation Understudy
   of 0.71 and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering
   of 0.73, which shows that the proposed model generates a meaningful
   summary from the given text.},

Abstract = {The widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in
   education and daily life necessitates a deeper understanding of
   students' awareness and attitudes. However, there is a lack of
   appropriate and psychometrically validated tools to assess these
   constructs reliably. This study aimed to examine the validity and
   reliability of a newly developed scale measuring secondary school
   students' awareness of generative artificial intelligence in the Turkish
   context. This methodological study employed a cross-sectional,
   descriptive, and correlational design. The research was conducted with
   444 secondary school students aged 14-18. Data were collected using a
   Demographic Information Form and the Generative Artificial Intelligence
   Awareness Scale. The study followed a three-stage process in line with
   the STROBE checklist: (1) item development, (2) expert evaluation for
   content validity, and (3) construct validity and reliability testing.
   Construct validity was assessed using Exploratory and Confirmatory
   Factor Analyses. Reliability was examined through Cronbach's alpha,
   corrected item-total correlations, and split-half reliability analysis.
   EFA revealed a three-factor structure: Basic Knowledge of Generative
   Artificial Intelligence, Positive Attitudes Toward Generative Artificial
   Intelligence, and Concerns About the Impacts of Generative Artificial
   Intelligence, explaining 54.29\% of the total variance. CFA supported
   the model, yielding acceptable fit indices (chi 2/df = 3.792, RMSEA =
   0.056, GFI = 0.905, CFI = 0.927, TLI = 0.919), indicating good model
   fit. The Cronbach's alpha for the total scale was 0.946, with subscale
   coefficients ranging from 0.822 to 0.925. Corrected item-total
   correlations ranged from 0.512 to 0.733. Split-half reliability for the
   first factor showed strong consistency (Spearman-Brown = 0.891, Guttman
   = 0.887, correlation between halves = 0.804). The findings demonstrate
   that the Turkish version of the generative artificial

Abstract = {Current advances in academic research stem from two main sources:
   artificial intelligence technologies and the specific field of
   generative artificial intelligence. However, the ethical use of these
   technologies and their implications for academic integrity has not been
   sufficiently investigated. Therefore, this research examines the ethical
   use of artificial intelligence technologies and Generative Artificial
   Intelligence in academic research. It focuses on the current field
   conditions, detection of research trends, and critical gaps. The study
   uses a combination of bibliometric and thematic content analysis methods
   to examine the methodological framework of AI, GenAI, and academic
   integrity from an interdisciplinary perspective. The research reveals
   that GenAI integration speed has accelerated across all research stages,
   including academic writing, literature review, data analysis, and
   hypothesis development. The study also identifies risks such as biased
   algorithms, plagiarism risk, false information production, and potential
   damage to academic integrity. The research ethics approaches developed
   by academic institutions and journals have not reached maturity in the
   context of AI. Future research on GenAI within academic processes
   requires forming ethical principles integrated with oversight systems
   and policy frameworks.},

Journal = {BJPSYCH BULLETIN},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 AUG 13},
Abstract = {Aims and method Advances in generative artificial intelligence,
   particularly through large language models, like GPT-4, have opened
   opportunities to develop cognitive agents to enhance clinical
   productivity, especially in complex secondary and tertiary care
   settings. However, as artificial intelligence begins to occupy the
   cognitive space traditionally held by human clinical reasoning,
   transparency becomes a significant concern. Unlike human
   decision-making, artificial intelligence-generated outputs may not be
   traceable to a transparent chain of clinical reasoning, potentially
   impacting safety if used without adequate `clinician reach' into the
   reasoning space of artificial intelligence.Results We highlight the need
   for a consensus framework to guide the responsible use of generative
   artificial intelligence in mental healthcare, which, it is argued, has
   cognitive demands and features distinct from physical medicine. We
   propose such a framework, Clinical Reach into the Cognitive Space
   (CRITiCS), to support clinician involvement in the deployment of these

Abstract = {Predicting coexistence patterns is a current challenge to understand
   diversity maintenance, especially in rich communities where these
   patterns' complexity is magnified through indirect interactions that
   prevent their approximation with classical experimental approaches. We
   explore cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques called Generative
   Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to predict species coexistence patterns
   in vegetation patches, training generative adversarial networks (GAN)
   and variational AutoEncoders (VAE) that are then used to unravel some of
   the mechanisms behind community assemblage. The GAN accurately
   reproduces real patches' species composition and plant species' affinity
   to different soil types, and the VAE also reaches a high level of
   accuracy, above 99\%. Using the artificially generated patches, we found
   that high-order interactions tend to suppress the positive effects of
   low-order interactions. Finally, by reconstructing successional
   trajectories, we could identify the pioneer species with larger
   potential to generate a high diversity of distinct patches in terms of
   species composition. Understanding the complexity of species coexistence
   patterns in diverse ecological communities requires new approaches
   beyond heuristic rules. Generative Artificial Intelligence can be a
   powerful tool to this end as it allows to overcome the inherent

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 6},
Abstract = {Product conceptual design is paramount in targeting specific customer
   segments, elevating brand equity, and ultimately boosting revenue
   sources. In the era of digitalisation, Generative Artificial
   Intelligence (GAI) is emerging to advance this process. This study
   introduces a pioneering framework, namely Generative Artificial
   Intelligence Product Designer (GAI-PD), that harnesses the power of GAI
   to revolutionise the design generation process, fostering efficiency,
   creativity, and responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption.
   GAI-PD is a novel multi-model framework integrating Generative
   Adversarial Network (GAN) and Large Language Model (LLM) that empowers
   designers to leverage GAN's capabilities for realistic visual output and
   LLM's natural language interaction. A comprehensive case example
   demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, achieving 90.23\% accuracy
   in generating valid design concepts and showing that hyperparameter
   tuning can significantly enhance image quality. From a managerial
   perspective, the findings indicate that adopting the GAI-PD framework
   can substantially reduce product development cycle times and accelerate
   time-to-market, offering a distinct competitive advantage. The study
   also explores avenues for future research, such as using advanced GAI
   models for high-resolution design generation and automated design
   evaluation, ultimately paving the way for enhanced design processes in
   diverse domains and promoting responsible AI adoption.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A significant problem in the field of hardware security consists of
   hardware trojan (HT) viruses. The insertion of HTs into a circuit can be
   applied for each phase of the circuit chain of production. HTs degrade
   the infected circuit, destroy it or leak encrypted data. Nowadays,
   efforts are being made to address HTs through machine learning (ML)
   techniques, mainly for the gate-level netlist (GLN) phase, but there are
   some restrictions. Specifically, the number and variety of normal and
   infected circuits that exist through the free public libraries, such as
   Trust-HUB, are based on the few samples of benchmarks that have been
   created from circuits large in size. Thus, it is difficult, based on
   these data, to develop robust ML-based models against HTs. In this
   paper, we propose a new deep learning (DL) tool named Generative
   Artificial Intelligence Netlists SynthesIS (GAINESIS). GAINESIS is based
   on the Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (WCGAN)
   algorithm and area-power analysis features from the GLN phase and
   synthesizes new normal and infected circuit samples for this phase.
   Based on our GAINESIS tool, we synthesized new data sets, different in
   size, and developed and compared seven ML classifiers. The results
   demonstrate that our new generated data sets significantly enhance the
   performance of ML classifiers compared with the initial data set of
   Trust-HUB.},

Abstract = {Generative AI is an emerging tool in higher education; however, its
   connection with transversal competencies, as well as their sustainable

   scientific and conceptual development of generative artificial

   transversal competencies, strategic processes for its sustainable
   implementation, and global trends in academic production. A systematic
   literature review (PRISMA) was conducted on the Web of Science, Scopus,
   and PubMed, analyzing 35 studies for narrative synthesis and 897
   publications for bibliometric analysis. The transversal competencies
   identified were: Academic Integrity, Critical Thinking, Innovation,
   Ethics, Creativity, Communication, Collaboration, AI Literacy,
   Responsibility, Digital Literacy, AI Ethics, Autonomous Learning,
   Self-Regulation, Flexibility, and Leadership. The conceptual framework
   connotes the interdisciplinary nature and five key processes were
   identified to achieve the sustainable integration of Generative AI in
   higher education oriented to the development of transversal
   competencies: (1) critical and ethical appropriation, (2) institutional
   management of technological infrastructure, (3) faculty development, (4)
   curricular transformation, and (5) pedagogical innovation. On
   bibliometric behavior, scientific articles predominate, with few
   systematic reviews. China leads in publication volume, and social
   sciences are the most prominent area. It is concluded that generative

Abstract = {The emergence of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence systems has
   brought and will continue to bring about significant transformations in
   various areas of socio-economic activity. Education is no exception,
   being profoundly influenced by these technological developments.
   Substantial changes are expected in teaching, learning and assessment
   processes, impacting both teachers and students. Teachers will need to
   acquire new skills to integrate artificial intelligence into their
   teaching activities, and students will have to learn to use these
   technologies to develop their creativity and innovative thinking skills.
   These transformations will influence educational curricula and require
   adjustments in educational policies. Our study focused on how the 292
   students of the Politehnica University of Timi \& scedil;oara, of both
   genders and from 4 years of study, from the undergraduate level, from 9
   faculties perceive artificial intelligence and its impact on their

   students' perceptions of the influence of generative artificial
   intelligence (GenAI) on their learning activities both in the classroom
   and at home. We also investigated their views on the long-term effects
   of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on education. The results
   indicate a positive but reserved perception, mainly due to uncertainties
   about future developments of this technology. This attitude is
   influenced more by a lack of control over the unknown than by pessimism

   single mediating role of self-efficacy, and the chain mediating role of
   problem-based learning and self-efficacy. Furthermore, a moderated chain
   mediation model demonstrates that higher levels of generative artificial
   intelligence usage among students strengthen the chain mediating effect
   of problem-based learning and self-efficacy in the relationship between
   perceived teachers' transformational leadership and employability. These
   results elucidate the intrinsic mechanism by which teachers'
   transformational leadership impacts college students' employability
   empowered by generative artificial intelligence and extend the
   application of Social Cognitive Career Theory and Distributed Cognition
   Theory within the domain of employability research.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and the automation of creative work have
   received little attention in craft education. This study aimed to
   address this gap by exploring Finnish pre-service craft teachers' and
   teacher educators' (N = 15) insights into the potential benefits and
   challenges of AI, particularly text-to-image generative AI. This study
   implemented a hands-on workshop on creative making with text-to-image
   generative AI in order to stimulate discourses and capture imaginaries
   concerning generative AI. The results revealed that making with AI
   inspired teachers to consider the unique nature of crafts as well as the
   tensions and tradeoffs of adopting generative AI in craft practices. The
   teachers identified concerns in data-driven design, including
   algorithmic bias, copyright violations and black-boxing creativity, as
   well as in power relationships, hybrid influencing and behaviour
   engineering. The article concludes with a discussion of the complicated
   relationships the results uncovered between creative making and
   generative AI.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and edge intelligence (EI) are
   driving the evolution of traditional vehicular networks toward the

   characteristics present significant challenges to direct knowledge
   sharing. Furthermore, conventional methods that independently optimize
   fine-tuning and inference lack the foresight to achieve long-term
   network benefits. To address these challenges, we propose the
   GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end
   intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference.
   GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging
   data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow
   facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference
   with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in
   the IIoV. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
   mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in

Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Generative pretrained transformer models have been popular recently due
   to their enhanced capabilities and performance. In contrast to many
   existing artificial intelligence models, generative pretrained
   transformer models can perform with very limited training data.
   Generative pretrained transformer 3 (GPT-3) is one of the latest
   releases in this pipeline, demonstrating human-like logical and
   intellectual responses to prompts. Some examples include writing essays,
   answering complex questions, matching pronouns to their nouns, and
   conducting sentiment analyses. However, questions remain with regard to
   its implementation in health care, specifically in terms of
   operationalization and its use in clinical practice and research. In
   this viewpoint paper, we briefly introduce GPT-3 and its capabilities
   and outline considerations for its implementation and operationalization
   in clinical practice through a use case. The implementation
   considerations include (1) processing needs and information systems
   infrastructure, (2) operating costs, (3) model biases, and (4)
   evaluation metrics. In addition, we outline the following three major
   operational factors that drive the adoption of GPT-3 in the US health
   care system: (1) ensuring Health Insurance Portability and
   Accountability Act compliance, (2) building trust with health care
   providers, and (3) establishing broader access to the GPT-3 tools. This
   viewpoint can inform health care practitioners, developers, clinicians,
   and decision makers toward understanding the use of the powerful
   artificial intelligence tools integrated into hospital systems and
   health care.},

Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is revolutionizing
   ophthalmology imaging by addressing critical limitations in data
   availability, annotation costs, and clinical workflow automation. This
   review provides a comprehensive analysis of GenAI's technical
   innovations, clinical applications, and persistent challenges within the
   ophthalmic imaging domain. We first survey the evolution of generative
   architectures, from Generative Adversarial Networks to Diffusion Models
   and vision-language frameworks. These innovations enable novel
   applications including counterfactual pathology synthesis, longitudinal
   disease progression modeling, and post-treatment outcome visualization,
   which enhance diagnostic precision and patient engagement. We then
   systematically review methodological advancements in GenAI, with a
   focused analysis on key clinical application categories: image
   generation, cross-modal domain transfer, image enhancement,
   post-treatment prediction, image segmentation, and vision-language
   tasks. Finally, we critically evaluate generative models, evaluation
   methods, and persistent challenges, such as the need for standardized
   evaluation frameworks, anatomical fidelity validation, and equitable
   integration into global healthcare systems. By addressing these
   barriers, GenAI holds transformative potential to improve diagnostic
   accuracy, streamline personalized treatment workflows, and democratize

Abstract = {In this article, an AI-aided generative design workflow is presented for
   the geometrical optimisation of secondary reflectors of linear Fresnel
   concentrating collectors. The geometry of the secondary reflector is
   based on principles of non-imaging optics, for which the exact
   analytical solution is derived for a specific linear Fresnel system
   acting as a validation test case. The artificial intelligence-aided
   generative design workflow is then applied on the same system and the
   optimal geometry generated is compared against the analytical solution.
   It is shown that the secondary reflector geometry obtained from the
   artificial intelligence-aided generative design workflow approaches the
   shape of the one obtained using the analytical solution and can
   outperform the latter with respect to the magnitude of radiative power
   intercepted by the receiver and radiative flux distribution at the
   receiver aperture.},

Abstract = {The agriculture and food (agri-food) sector faces rising global concerns
   about its sustainability and resilience to climate events. Thus, new
   solutions are needed to ensure environmental and food security.
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers inventive solutions to improve
   agricultural and food production practices. Generative AI methods, such
   as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders, and
   large language models (LLMs), add to the transformative process
   initiated by AI and expert systems in agricultural and food-related
   practices to enhance productivity, sustainability, and resilience. This
   study categorizes generative AI approaches and their capabilities in
   agri-food systems and provides a comprehensive review of the current
   landscape of generative AI applications in the sector. It discusses the
   impact of these technologies on enhancing agricultural productivity,
   food quality, and safety, as well as sustainability, presenting
   potential use cases like combatting climate change and foodborne disease
   modeling that highlight the practical applications and benefits of
   generative AI in agrifood. Furthermore, it addresses the ethical
   implications of deploying generative AI, including privacy, security,
   reliability, and unbiased decision-making.},

Abstract = {Background: A personal statement is a common requirement in medical
   residency and fellowship applications. Generative artificial
   intelligence may be used to create a personal statement for these

   OpenAI's Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and two
   applicant-written statements were collected. A survey was sent to
   obstetric anesthesia fellowship program directors in the United States
   to assess the perceived readability, authenticity, and originality of
   the four personal statements. In addition, the survey assessed
   perceptions of applicants who use artificial intelligence to write a
   personal statement, including their integrity, work ethic, reliability,
   intelligence, and English proficiency. Results: Surveyed fellowship
   directors could not accurately discern whether statements were
   applicant-written or artificial intelligence-generated. The artificial
   intelligence-generated personal statements were rated as more readable
   and original than the applicant-written statements. Most program
   directors were moderately or extremely concerned about the applicant's
   integrity, work ethic, and reliability if they suspected the applicant
   utilized ChatGPT. Conclusions: Program directors could not accurately
   discern if the statements were written by a person or artificial

Abstract = {PurposeThe rapid development and widespread application of artificial
   intelligence tools have raised concerns about how designers are
   embracing these technologies. This study investigates the factors
   influencing designers' behavioral intention to use and disclose the use
   of generative artificial intelligence.Design/methodology/approachA
   quantitative research approach was employed, designing a structured
   questionnaire based on Self-Determination Theory to assess the impact of
   various psychological and social dimensions. The questionnaire included
   dimensions such as autonomy, competence, relatedness, social influence,
   value fit and social innovativeness. A Partial Least Squares Structural
   Equation Modeling analysis was conducted on 309 valid responses from
   diverse design fields.FindingsCompetence and relatedness are significant
   factors influencing designers' continuance intention to use generative
   artificial intelligence. Although autonomy does not significantly affect
   continuance intention, it plays a crucial role in the decision to
   disclose artificial intelligence participation. Social influence and
   value fit significantly shape autonomy, competence and relatedness,
   while the impact of social innovativeness is relatively
   limited.Originality/valueThis study clarifies the factors influencing
   designers' continuance intention and disclosure of generative artificial
   intelligence tools from both individual and social dimensions, enhancing
   the understanding of the relationship between designers and generative
   artificial intelligence tools. It provides valuable insights for the

   the extensively researched, yet still growing, field of algorithmic
   predictions and decision-making, alongside the varied positive and
   negative consumer reactions it elicits. Subsequently, we delve into the
   just emerging field of GenAI. Here, we differentiate between Convergent

   pre-defined task completion, and Divergent Thinking GenAI, which is more
   domain-general and oriented towards new task fulfillment. For each of
   these realms, we identify key areas for future investigation.},

   statistically significant difference was observed between the rates of
   correct and incorrect answers to the questions on the three artificial
   intelligence chatbots (P = 0.206).Conclusions: Artificial intelligence
   chatbots can be used to access accurate information about retinal and
   vitreous diseases and treatment modalities. However, the information
   obtained may not always be correct, and care should be taken about its

Abstract = {This article focuses on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)
   systems and their impact on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). A
   concise snapshot of the international legal framework will provide the
   coordinates to address the evolution of European and Italian regulations
   on the subject and to place them in the current doctrinal and
   jurisprudential debate. To generate high-quality results, GenAIsystems
   require significant amounts of operational and training data, often
   containing information protected by IPR. Some important US cases are
   laying the foundations for establishing what rights should regulate the
   impact of GenAI on human creativity, and while US courts contemplate
   where and when fair use may be permissible, European institutions have
   recently approved the final test of the first Regulation in the world on
   Artificial Intelligence (AI Act). The challenge is to create a European
   regulatory framework capable of standing the test of time, harmonizing
   national IPR and maximizing the advantages of GenAI in content creation
   without penalizing technological evolution or human creativity. The
   matter is the subject of a lively debate involving men of science and

Abstract = {Purpose of review This review explores recent key advancements in
   artificial intelligence for acute and intensive care medicine. As
   artificial intelligence rapidly evolves, this review aims to elucidate
   its current applications, future possibilities, and the vital challenges
   that are associated with its integration into emergency medical
   dispatch, triage, medical consultation and ICUs.
   Recent findings The integration of artificial intelligence in emergency
   medical dispatch (EMD) facilitates swift and accurate assessment. In the
   emergency department (ED), artificial intelligence driven triage models
   leverage diverse patient data for improved outcome predictions,
   surpassing human performance in retrospective studies. Artificial
   intelligence can streamline medical documentation in the ED and enhances
   medical imaging interpretation. The introduction of large multimodal
   generative models showcases the future potential to process varied
   biomedical data for comprehensive decision support. In the ICU,
   artificial intelligence applications range from early warning systems to
   treatment suggestions.
   Summary Despite promising academic strides, widespread artificial
   intelligence adoption in acute and critical care is hindered by ethical,
   legal, technical, organizational, and validation challenges. Despite
   these obstacles, artificial intelligence's potential to streamline
   clinical workflows is evident. When these barriers are overcome, future
   advancements in artificial intelligence have the potential to transform
   the landscape of patient care for acute and intensive care medicine.},

Abstract = {In this essay, we characterize three paradoxical imaginaries that
   structure the development of generative artificial intelligence (genAI).
   At the institutional level, these technologies develop in a context that
   celebrates openness and liberality. Yet, both in the US and in Europe,
   they serve to centralize power and resources. At the organizational
   level, while the imaginary is that these technologies make work more
   interesting, we show that they rather produce anxiety and a new class of
   precarious workers. At the epistemic level, generative artificial
   intelligence promises access to unlimited knowledge. This knowledge may
   appear robust, as these technologies become performative. However, the
   knowledge they produce is doubtful. Overall, these technologies
   centralize power and exclude, they standardize knowledge, and they
   produce, reproduce, amplify and extend various structures of domination.},

Month = {2024 DEC 31},
Abstract = {The application of generative artificial intelligence in the tourism
   industry is deepening and playing a key role in enhancing personalized
   services. However, there are still significant gaps in specific studies
   dealing with the subsequent impact on tourists' actual decisions and
   their economic significance. Based on prospect theory and social impact
   theory, this study explores in depth the effects of artificial
   intelligence-generated content and user-generated content on tourists'
   emotions and decision-making process under different goal frameworks.
   Through a series of two scenario-based experiments, this study confirmed
   previous research that gain-framing content is more effective in
   stimulating tourists' emotions and facilitating travel decisions. In
   addition, this study further found that in the context of the use of
   generative artificial intelligence, the loss-framing content will obtain
   the emotional arousal of potential tourists and the generation of travel
   decisions. The research has practical implications for management,
   highlighting potential synergies and collaboration between
   human-generated and artificial intelligence-generated content in
   tourism. Designed to help tourism destination management organizations
   make informed judgments based on accurate information, artificial
   intelligence-based big data analytics better meet the preferences and
   needs of tourists.},

Abstract = {Objective: To identify and quantify ability bias in generative
   artificial intelligence large language model chatbots, specifically
   OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Design: Observational study of
   language usage in generative artificial intelligence models. Setting:
   Investigation-only browser profile restricted to ChatGPT and Gemini.
   Participants: Each chatbot generated 60 descriptions of people prompted
   without specified functional status, 30 descriptions of people with a
   disability, 30 descriptions of patients with a disability, and 30
   descriptions of athletes with a disability (N=300). Interventions: Not
   applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Generated descriptions produced by
   the models were parsed into words that were linguistically analyzed into
   favorable qualities or limiting qualities. Results: Both large language
   models significantly underestimated disability in a population of
   people, and linguistic analysis showed that descriptions of people,
   patients, and athletes with a disability were generated as having
   significantly fewer favorable qualities and significantly more
   limitations than people without a disability in both ChatGPT and Gemini.
   Conclusions: Generative artificial intelligence chatbots demonstrate
   quantifiable ability bias and often exclude people with disabilities in
   their responses. Ethical use of these generative large language model
   chatbots in medical systems should recognize this limitation, and
   further consideration should be taken in developing equitable artificial

Title = {Assessing the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Russian Labor Market
   Development Scenarios: Industry Analysis},
Journal = {ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {18},

Pages = {170-189},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence has become an essential element oftechnological
   progress, while generative artificial intelligence occupies a special
   place as an innovative general-purpose technology. Given the rapid
   development of this technology and its high potential for mass adoption
   in various economic sectors, it becomes important to assess the impact
   of this technology on the labor market. The modern Russian labor market
   is characterized by low unemployment, staff shortages, and intersectoral
   imbalances. An urgent scientific task is to model scenarios for the
   development of the labor market in the context of sectors, taking into
   account the influence of generative artificial intelligence. The aim of
   the work is to assess the potential impact of the mass use of generative
   artificial intelligence on the labor market, due to changes in labor
   efficiency in some professions and industries, based on the analysis of
   statistical and expert data and economic and mathematical modeling of
   possible scenarios for the development of the labor market. Economic
   sectors were divided into three groups depending on the rate of change
   in personnel needs, based on the analysis of the Beveridge curve, which
   shows the dependence of the level of needs on the unemployment rate.
   Using existing statistical data and expert assessments, we determine the
   degree of influence of generative artificial intelligence on labor
   efficiency in various industries. We put forward an approach that helps
   to obtain estimates of possible scenarios for the development of
   sectoral labor markets for the period up to 2030, based on official
   forecasts of ministries (Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian
   Federation, Ministry of Labor of the Russian Federation) for the period
   up to 2026, their extrapolation, and superimposition of the impact of
   mass use of generative artificial intelligence (as a disturbing effect).
   The results obtained suggest that the severity of staff shortage issue
   in general can be partially reduced by using generative artificial
   intelligence; thus, we identified industries in which (a) it is possible
   to address the problem of staff shortage at the current level of needs,
   and (b) staff shortage will persist. Modeling the migration of
   professions and personnel between industries seems promising, because
   the expected effect of mass technology adoption will not only change the
   balance of labor resources, but also lead to the need to re-profile some
   of the personnel.},

   clarity regarding how generative artificial intelligence is being
   integrated into scholarly communication and who the key stakeholders are

   explore, through a scoping review, how generative artificial
   intelligence tools are being incorporated into scholarly communication
   and publishing processes, the challenges associated with their
   integration, and the key stakeholders involved. A scoping review was
   conducted to identify the most relevant information on the integration
   and use of generative artificial intelligence in scholarly communication
   in specialized databases; it included a total of 90 studies that
   responded to the research questions. Findings indicated that generative
   artificial intelligence is being utilized to translate, write, and edit
   academic articles; in addition to expediting peer review processes.
   Ethical concerns related to algorithmic bias, plagiarism, and
   difficulties recogniz-ing artificial intelligence-generated content and
   the lack of globally accepted policies regarding its use were also
   evidenced. Similarly, several key stakeholders in the in-tegration and
   use of generative artificial intelligence were identified, including

   into the classroom. Teachers who have used Artificial Intelligence in
   education were given a questionnaire, and the comments of teachers who
   have integrated these tools in education in various activities were
   analysed. The data analysis shows that generative and conversational
   tools in Artificial Intelligence are the most used, both for lesson
   preparation and to integrate these tools in the classroom with students.
   It was also found that there is a concern for adequate training, and a
   worry about the possible spread of plagiarism problems was perceived. In
   general, Artificial Intelligence is considered to be a tool that can
   improve teaching and learning in the classroom. The qualitative analysis
   has made it possible to generate a classification of educational
   activities that integrate Artificial Intelligence in education.},

Abstract = {Purpose This conceptual paper examines what underlies decision-making in
   generative change processes to explore how generative artificial
   intelligence (GAI) might shape the future of organisational
   change.Design/methodology/approach This investigation draws on Snowden
   and Stanbridge's (2004) social complexity concept, Archer's (1995)
   morphogenetic/morphostatic explanatory methodology and Mackenzie and
   Bititci's (2023) social systems-based model for organisational change to
   explain how structure, culture and agency influence generative change
   processes in complex adaptive social systems.Findings Both human-based
   decision-making and machine-based decision-making have roles to play in
   generative change. This paper proposes that human reflexivity mediates
   ideas, whereas the material aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) and
   GAI mediate tasks. The former shapes the change interventions that take

   execution.Practical implications In generative change processes, AI and
   GAI technologies should be focused on tasks that support human-based

   learn the probability distribution that generated them. Generative
   Adversarial Networks (GANs) are then able to generate more examples from
   the estimated probability distribution. Generative models based on deep
   learning are common, but GANs are among the most successful generative
   models (especially in terms of their ability to generate realistic
   high-resolution images). GANs have been successfully applied to a wide
   variety of tasks (mostly in research settings) but continue to present
   unique challenges and research opportunities because they are based on
   game theory while most other approaches to generative modeling are based
   on optimization.},

Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been selectively
   adopted across the academic community to help researchers complete tasks
   in a more efficient manner. The widespread release of the Chat
   Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) platform in 2022 has made
   these tools more accessible to scholars around the world. Despite their
   tremendous potential, studies have uncovered that large language model
   (LLM)-based generative AI tools have issues with plagiarism, AI
   hallucinations, and inaccurate or fabricated references. This raises
   legitimate concern about the utility, accuracy, and integrity of AI when
   used to write academic manuscripts. Currently, there is little clear
   guidance for healthcare simulation scholars outlining the ways that
   generative AI could be used to legitimately support the production of
   academic literature. In this paper, we discuss how widely available,
   LLM-powered generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT) can help in the academic
   writing process. We first explore how academic publishers are
   positioning the use of generative AI tools and then describe potential
   issues with using these tools in the academic writing process. Finally,
   we discuss three categories of specific ways generative AI tools can be
   used in an ethically sound manner and offer four key principles that can
   help guide researchers to produce high-quality research outputs with the
   highest of academic integrity.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content Empowers College Students'
   Critical Thinking Skills: What, How, and Why},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Despite the increasing number of studies indicating that generative
   artificial intelligence is conducive to cultivating college students'
   critical thinking skills, research on the impact of college students'
   use of generative artificial intelligence on their critical thinking
   skills in an open learning environment is still scarce. This study aims
   to investigate whether the use of generative artificial intelligence by
   college students in an open learning environment can effectively enhance
   their critical thinking skills. The study is centered around the
   following questions: Does the use of generative artificial intelligence
   in an open learning environment enhance college students' critical
   thinking skills (what)? What is the mechanism by which the use of
   generative artificial intelligence affects college students' critical
   thinking (how)? From the perspective of self-regulated learning theory
   and learning motivation theory, what are the reasons for the impact of
   generative artificial intelligence on college students' critical
   thinking skills (why)? To this end, the study employs questionnaires and
   interviews to collect data. The questionnaire data are subjected to
   descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, multiple
   stepwise regression analysis, and mediation effect analysis. Based on
   the analysis of interview materials and survey questionnaire data, the
   study reveals the impacts and mechanisms of college students' use of
   generative artificial intelligence tools on their critical thinking
   skills. The findings of the study are as follows. First, the frequency
   of artificial intelligence use is unrelated to critical thinking skills,
   but using it for reflective thinking helps to develop critical thinking
   skills. Second, students with strong self-regulated learning skills are
   more likely to use generative artificial intelligence for reflective
   thinking and achieve better development in critical thinking skills.
   Third, students with strong intrinsic learning motivation are more
   likely to use generative artificial intelligence for reflective thinking
   and achieve better development in critical thinking skills.
   Consequently, the article analyzes the reasons from the perspectives of
   self-regulated learning theory and learning motivation theory and offers
   insights into how to properly use generative artificial intelligence to
   promote the development of critical thinking skills from the
   perspectives of higher education institutions, college teachers, and
   college students.},

   extract significant building blocks as subgraphs and merge them into new
   compositions. Finally, we explored the application of generative

Abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) represents a shift from AI's ability to
   ``recognize{''} to its ability to ``generate{''} solutions for a wide
   range of tasks. As generated solutions and applications grow more
   complex and multi-faceted, new needs, objectives, and possibilities for
   explainability (XAI) have emerged. This work elaborates on why XAI has
   gained importance with the rise of GenAI and the challenges it poses for
   explainability research. We also highlight new and emerging criteria
   that explanations should meet, such as verifiability, interactivity,
   security, and cost considerations. To achieve this, we focus on
   surveying existing literature. Additionally, we provide a taxonomy of
   relevant dimensions to better characterize existing XAI mechanisms and
   methods for GenAI. We explore various approaches to ensure XAI, ranging
   from training data to prompting. Our paper provides a concise technical
   background of GenAI for non-technical readers, focusing on text and
   images to help them understand new or adapted XAI techniques for GenAI.
   However, due to the extensive body of work on GenAI, we chose not to
   delve into detailed aspects of XAI related to the evaluation and usage
   of explanations. Consequently, the manuscript appeals to both technical
   experts and professionals from other fields, such as social scientists
   and information systems researchers. Our research roadmap outlines over
   ten directions for future investigation.},

Abstract = {This study responds to the increasing call for thoughtful theological

   the role of personal theological reflection using Generative Artificial

   investigates how both educators and students might utilize AI-generated

   insight and foster ethical discernment, particularly through the lens of
   theological virtue ethics. AI is not a substitute for all human tasks.
   However, the use of AI holds potential for theology and catechetical
   religious education. Following Gl \& auml;ser-Zikuda's model of
   Self-Reflecting Methods of Learning Research, this study systematically
   engages in reflective observation to examine how the use of GenAI in
   theology classrooms has influenced personal theological thinking,
   pedagogical practices, and ethical considerations. It documents
   experiences using common generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Canva,
   Meta AI, Deep AI, and Gencraft in theology classes. The principles of

   networking, AIGX collaborates closely with physical, data link, network,
   and application layers to enhance real-time network management that
   responds to various system and service settings as well as application
   and user requirements. Networks, in return, serve as crucial components

Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {The advent and growing popularity of generative artificial intelligence
   (GenAI) holds the potential to revolutionise AI applications in forensic
   psychiatry and criminal justice, which traditionally relied on
   discriminative AI algorithms. Generative AI models mark a significant
   shift from the previously prevailing paradigm through their ability to
   generate seemingly new realistic data and analyse and integrate a vast
   amount of unstructured content from different data formats. This
   potential extends beyond reshaping conventional practices, like risk
   assessment, diagnostic support, and treatment and rehabilitation plans,
   to creating new opportunities in previously underexplored areas, such as
   training and education. This paper examines the transformative impact of
   generative artificial intelligence on AI applications in forensic
   psychiatry and criminal justice. First, it introduces generative AI and
   its prevalent models. Following this, it reviews the current
   applications of discriminative AI in forensic psychiatry. Subsequently,
   it presents a thorough exploration of the potential of generative AI to
   transform established practices and introduce novel applications through
   multimodal generative models, data generation and data augmentation.
   Finally, it provides a comprehensive overview of ethical and legal
   issues associated with deploying generative AI models, focusing on their
   impact on individuals as well as their broader societal implications. In
   conclusion, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse
   concerning the dynamic challenges of generative AI applications in
   forensic contexts, highlighting potential opportunities, risks, and
   challenges. It advocates for interdisciplinary collaboration and
   emphasises the necessity for thorough, responsible evaluations of
   generative AI models before widespread adoption into domains where
   decisions with substantial life-altering consequences are routinely

Abstract = {As advances in artificial intelligence (AI) continue to transform and
   revolutionize the field of medicine, understanding the potential uses of
   generative AI in health care becomes increasingly important. Generative
   AI, including models such as generative adversarial networks and large
   language models, shows promise in transforming medical diagnostics,
   research, treatment planning, and patient care. However, these data
   -intensive systems pose new threats to protected health information.
   This Viewpoint paper aims to explore various categories of generative AI
   in health care, including medical diagnostics, drug discovery, virtual
   health assistants, medical research, and clinical decision support,
   while identifying security and privacy threats within each phase of the
   life cycle of such systems (ie, data collection, model development, and
   implementation phases). The objectives of this study were to analyze the
   current state of generative AI in health care, identify opportunities
   and privacy and security challenges posed by integrating these
   technologies into existing health care infrastructure, and propose
   strategies for mitigating security and privacy risks. This study
   highlights the importance of addressing the security and privacy threats
   associated with generative AI in health care to ensure the safe and
   effective use of these systems. The findings of this study can inform
   the development of future generative AI systems in health care and help
   health care organizations better understand the potential benefits and
   risks associated with these systems. By examining the use cases and
   benefits of generative AI across diverse domains within health care,
   this paper contributes to theoretical discussions surrounding AI ethics,
   security vulnerabilities, and data privacy regulations. In addition,
   this study provides practical insights for stakeholders looking to adopt
   generative AI solutions within their organizations.},

Abstract = {The introduction of accessible generative artificial intelligence opens
   promising opportunities for the implementation of personalized learning
   methods in any educational environment. Personalized learning has been
   conceptualized for a long time, but it has only recently become
   realistic and truly achievable. In this paper, we propose an affordable
   and sustainable approach toward personalizing learning materials as part
   of the complete educational process. We have created a tool within a
   pre-existing learning management system at a software engineering
   college that automatically generates learning materials based on the
   learning outcomes provided by the professor for a particular class. The
   learning materials were composed in three distinct styles, the initial
   one being the traditional professor style and the other two variations
   adopting a pop-culture influence, namely Batman and Wednesday Addams.
   Each lesson, besides being delivered in three different formats,
   contained automatically generated multiple-choice questions that
   students could use to check their progress. This paper contains complete
   instructions for developing such a tool with the help of large language
   models using OpenAI's API and an analysis of the preliminary experiment
   of its usage performed with the help of 20 college students studying
   software engineering at a European university. Participation in the
   study was optional and on voluntary basis. Each student's tool usage was
   quantified, and two questionnaires were conducted: one immediately after
   subject completion and another 6 months later to assess both immediate
   and long-term effects, perceptions, and preferences. The results
   indicate that students found the multiple variants of the learning
   materials really engaging. While predominantly utilizing the traditional
   variant of the learning materials, they found this approach inspiring,
   would recommend it to other students, and would like to see it more in
   classes. The most popular feature were the automatically generated
   quiz-style tests that they used to assess their understanding.
   Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of various versions of
   learning materials leads to an increase in students' study time,
   especially for students who have not mastered the topic otherwise. The
   study's small sample size of 20 students restricts its ability to
   generalize its findings, but its results provide useful early insights
   and lay the groundwork for future research on AI-supported educational
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) promises various new opportunities to

   Using causal loop diagramming, we flesh out the socio-technical dynamics
   of these mechanisms and explore the organizational requirements of
   implementing AI. The resulting topology of generative mechanisms
   contributes to the research on AI management by offering rich insights

Abstract = {The field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is experiencing
   rapid advancements, impacting a multitude of sectors, from computer
   vision to healthcare. This paper provides a comprehensive review of
   generative AI's evolution, significance, and applications, including the
   foundational architectures such as generative adversarial networks
   (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), autoregressive models,
   flow-based models, and diffusion models. We delve into the impact of
   generative algorithms on computer vision, natural language processing,
   artistic creation, and healthcare, demonstrating their revolutionary
   potential in data augmentation, text and speech synthesis, and medical
   image interpretation. While the transformative capabilities of
   generative AI are acknowledged, the paper also examines ethical
   concerns, most notably the advent of deepfakes, calling for the
   development of robust detection frameworks and responsible use
   guidelines. As generative AI continues to evolve, driven by advances in
   neural network architectures and deep learning methodologies, this paper
   provides a holistic overview of the current landscape and a roadmap for
   future research and ethical considerations in generative AI.},

Title = {Synthetic ethnography: Field devices for the qualitative study of
   generative models},
Journal = {BIG DATA \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Advancements in generative artificial intelligence have led to a rapid
   proliferation of machine learning models capable of synthesizing text,
   images, sounds, and other kinds of content. While the increasing realism
   of synthetic content stokes fears about misinformation and triggers
   debates around intellectual property, generative models are adopted
   across creative industries and synthetic media seep into cultural
   production. Qualitative research in the social and human sciences has
   dedicated comparatively little attention to this category of machine
   learning, particularly in terms of what types of novel research
   methodology they both demand and facilitate. In this article, we propose
   a methodological approach for the qualitative study of generative models
   grounded on the experimentation with field devices which we call
   synthetic ethnography. Synthetic ethnography is not simply a qualitative
   research methodology applied to the study of the social and cultural
   contexts developing around generative artificial intelligence, but also
   strives to envision practical and experimental ways to repurpose these
   models as research tools in their own right. After briefly introducing
   generative models and revisiting the trajectory of digital ethnographic
   research, we discuss three case studies for which the authors have
   developed experimental field devices to study different aspects of
   generative artificial intelligence ethnographically. In the conclusion,
   we derive a broader methodological proposal from these case studies,
   arguing that synthetic ethnography facilitates insights into how the
   algorithmic processes, training datasets and latent spaces behind these
   systems modulate bias, reconfigure agency, and challenge epistemological
   categories.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Self-adaptive systems (SASs) are designed to handle changes and
   uncertainties through a feedback loop with four core functionalities:
   monitoring, analyzing, planning, and execution. Recently, generative
   artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language
   models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and
   logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the
   functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to
   employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and
   challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a
   comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex
   due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the
   technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid
   evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this article aims to
   provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that
   outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's
   within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from
   four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories
   to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered
   around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii)
   improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within
   human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research
   roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs.
   The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to
   be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of
   SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on
   current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation

   models and practice opportunities. The use of generative chatbots to
   offload lower level tasks, however, may harm expert development by
   disrupting knowledge communities. Finally, a lack of domain knowledge in
   nonexpert users may limit the effectiveness of generative chatbots in
   supporting higher level cognition and agency. Overall, existing research
   suggests that the potential for generative chatbots to support users'

Abstract = {The swift progress of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools
   offers remarkable potential for revolutionizing educational methods and
   enhancing social sustainability. Despite its potential, understanding
   the factors driving its adoption and how that affects social
   sustainability remains underexplored. This study aims to address this
   gap by integrating AI attributes ({''}perceived anthropomorphism,{''}
   ``perceived intelligence,{''} and ``perceived animacy{''}) with the
   theory of planned behavior and the technology-environmental, economic,
   and social sustainability theory (T-EESST) to develop a theoretical
   research model. Utilizing a hybrid structural equation modeling and
   artificial neural network approach, we analyzed data collected from 1048
   university students to evaluate the developed model. Our findings
   revealed that while perceived behavioral control has an insignificant
   impact on generative AI use, attitudes emerge as the most critical
   factor, further reinforced by the significant role of subjective norms.
   Perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived
   animacy were also found to influence students' attitudes significantly.
   More importantly, the findings supported the role of generative AI in
   positively affecting social sustainability, aligning with the principles
   of T-EESST. This study's significance lies in its holistic examination
   of the interplay between technological attributes, motivational aspects,

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has impressed the
   world with its ability to create text, images, and videos. However,
   there are still areas in which GAI produces undesirable or unintended
   results due to being ``uncertain{''}. Before wider use of AI-generated
   content, it is important to identify concepts where GAI is uncertain to
   ensure the usage thereof is ethical and to direct efforts for
   improvement. This study proposes a general pipeline to automatically
   quantify uncertainty within GAI. To measure uncertainty, the textual
   prompt to a text-to-image model is compared to captions supplied by four
   image-to-text models (GIT, BLIP, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP). Its
   evaluation is based on machine translation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR,
   and SPICE) and word embedding's cosine similarity (Word2Vec, GloVe,
   FastText, DistilRoBERTa, MiniLM-6, and MiniLM-12). The generative AI
   models performed consistently across the metrics; however, the vector
   space models yielded the highest average similarity, close to 80\%,
   which suggests more ideal and ``certain{''} results. Suggested future
   work includes identifying metrics that best align with a human baseline
   to ensure quality and consideration for more GAI models. The work within
   can be used to automatically identify concepts in which GAI is
   ``uncertain{''} to drive research aimed at increasing confidence in
   these areas.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as GPT-4, and the
   chatbot interface ChatGPT, show promise for a variety of applications in
   radiology and health care. However, like other AI tools, ChatGPT has
   limitations and potential pitfalls that must be considered before
   adopting it for teaching, clinical practice, and beyond. We summarize
   five major emerging use cases for ChatGPT and generative AI in radiology
   across the levels of increasing data complexity, along with pitfalls
   associated with each. As the use of AI in health care continues to grow,
   it is crucial for radiologists (and all physicians) to stay informed and

Abstract = {This qualitative study explores the potential of generative artificial
   intelligence (AI) to improve the academic writing skills of a large
   student cohort within the context of a distance learning institution.
   Utilising qualitative methods, the research explores diverse approaches
   and applications of generative AI to elevate teaching and learning
   experiences. Grounded in socio-cultural theory and a human -AI
   collaboration framework, the study highlights the synergistic interplay
   between human intelligence and generative AI capabilities. Email
   interviews with lecturers, focus group discussions with students, and
   informal discussions with markers on a WhatsApp group helped researchers
   to (1) understand lecturers' perceptions of generative AI integration in
   the Academic Writing module, (2) explore students' perspectives on the
   potential of generative AI as a guide in the Academic Writing module,
   and (3) examine the potential of generative AI on students' motivation
   to enhance their academic writing skills. Findings from the study reveal
   that the potential of generative AI has a positive impact on teaching
   and learning experiences, providing innovative opportunities for
   academics. This research contributes to the discourse on the
   intersection of generative AI and education, reiterating the innovative
   potential of generative AI in redefining pedagogical strategies and
   shaping the future of distance learning.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has become a focal point of interest across
   various sectors due to its ability to generate creative and realistic
   outputs. A specific subset, generative artificial intelligence, has seen
   significant growth, particularly in late 2022. Tools like ChatGPT,
   Dall-E, or Midjourney have democratized access to Large Language Models,
   enabling the creation of human-like content. However, the concept
   `Generative Artificial Intelligence' lacks a universally accepted
   definition, leading to potential misunderstandings. While a model that
   produces any output can be technically seen as generative, the
   Artificial Intelligent research community often reserves the term for
   complex models that generate high-quality, human-like material. This
   paper presents a literature mapping of AI-driven content generation,
   analyzing 631 solutions published over the last five years to better
   understand and characterize the Generative Artificial Intelligence
   landscape. Our findings suggest a dichotomy in the understanding and
   application of the term ``Generative AI{''}. While the broader public
   often interprets ``Generative AI{''} as AI-driven creation of tangible
   content, the AI research community mainly discusses generative
   implementations with an emphasis on the models in use, without
   explicitly categorizing their work under the term ``Generative AI{''}.},

Journal = {CURRENT REVIEWS IN CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {89-97},
Abstract = {Predictions are made by artificial intelligence, especially through
   machine learning, which uses algorithms and past knowledge. Notably,
   there has been an increase in interest in using artificial intelligence,
   particularly generative AI, in the pharmacovigilance of pharmaceuticals
   under development, as well as those already in the market. This review
   was conducted to understand how generative AI can play an important role
   in pharmacovigilance and improving drug safety monitoring. Data from
   previously published articles and news items were reviewed in order to
   obtain information. We used PubMed and Google Scholar as our search
   engines, and keywords (pharmacovigilance, artificial intelligence,
   machine learning, drug safety, and patient safety) were used. In toto,
   we reviewed 109 articles published till 31st January 2024, and the
   obtained information was interpreted, compiled, evaluated, and
   conclusions were reached. Generative AI has transformative potential in
   pharmacovigilance, showcasing benefits, such as enhanced adverse event
   detection, data-driven risk prediction, and optimized drug development.
   By making it easier to process and analyze big datasets, generative
   artificial intelligence has applications across a variety of disease
   states. Machine learning and automation in this field can streamline
   pharmacovigilance procedures and provide a more efficient way to assess
   safety-related data. Nevertheless, more investigation is required to
   determine how this optimization affects the caliber of safety analyses.
   In the near future, the increased utilization of artificial intelligence
   is anticipated, especially in predicting side effects and Adverse Drug
   Reactions (ADRs).},

Abstract = {The rapid progress of Artificial intelligence in generative modeling is
   marred by widespread misuse. In response, researchers turn to use-based
   restrictions-contractual terms prohibiting certain uses-as a

   are especially significant in open-source models: not only do they lack

Abstract = {The article critically analyzes how contemporary image practices
   involving generative artificial intelligence are entangled with
   processes of democratization. We demonstrate and discuss how generative
   artificial intelligence images raise questions of democratization and
   citizenship in terms of access, skills, validation, truths, and
   diversity. First, the article establishes a theoretical framework, which
   includes theory on democratization and aesthetics and lays the
   foundations for the analytical concepts of `formative' and `generative'
   visual citizenship. Next, we argue for the use of explorative and
   collaborative methods to investigate contemporary image practice, before
   analyzing the central part of our investigation, which takes the form of
   four collaborative workshops conducted in 2023 with external partners in
   different domains (the art scene, art therapy, education, and the news
   media). After analyzing insights from these workshops, the article
   significantly nuances how visual citizenship is at work in different
   manners depending on the different concrete image practices using
   generative artificial intelligence. Finally, we conclude that an
   aesthetic perspective offers valuable insights into foundational aspects
   of belonging to contemporary visual communities.},

Abstract = {Generative AI refers specifically to a class of Artificial Intelligence
   models that use existing data to create new content that reflects the
   underlying patterns of real-world data. This contribution presents a
   study that aims to show what the current perception of arts educators
   and students of arts education is with regard to generative Artificial
   Intelligence. It is a qualitative research study using focus groups as a
   data collection technique in order to obtain an overview of the
   participating subjects. The research design consists of two phases: (1)
   generation of illustrations from prompts by students, professionals and
   a generative AI tool; and (2) focus groups with students (N = 5) and
   educators (N = 5) of artistic education. In general, the perception of
   educators and students coincides in the usefulness of generative AI as a
   tool to support the generation of illustrations. However, they agree
   that the human factor cannot be replaced by generative AI. The results
   obtained allow us to conclude that generative AI can be used as a
   motivating educational strategy for arts education.},

Abstract = {The core challenge in directed energy deposition is to obtain high
   surface quality through process optimisation, which directly affects the
   mechanical properties of fabricated parts. However, for expensive
   materials like Ti-6Al-4V, the cost and time required to optimise process
   parameters can be excessive in inducing good surface quality. To
   mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel method with artificial
   intelligence to generate virtual surface morphology of Ti-6Al-4V parts
   by given process parameters. A high-resolution surface morphology image
   generation system has been developed by optimising conditional
   generative adversarial networks. The developed virtual surface matches
   experimental cases well with an Frechet inception distance score of 174,
   in the range of accurate matching. Microstructural analysis with parts
   fabricated with artificial intelligence guidance exhibited less textured
   microstructural behaviour on the surface which reduces the anisotropy in
   the columnar structure. This artificial intelligence guidance of virtual
   surface morphology can help to obtain high-quality parts
   cost-effectively.},

   associated with having social capital on both dimensions. In addition,
   the intensity and frequency of using generative AI are positively
   related to social capital, with more significant effects observed in

   This article explores how generative pre-trained transformers influence
   digital superintermediaries' market power, and examines whether
   generative artificial intelligence capabilities reinforce or challenge
   existing platform dominance. Using a conceptual literature analysis of
   platforms and artificial intelligence development patterns, the research
   uncovers a critical paradox: While generative pre-trained transformers
   represent revolutionary advancement, they create novel forms of
   artificial intelligence market concentration. The findings reveal how
   digital superintermediaries leverage artificial-intelligence-powered
   platforms through control over computational resources and data access,
   creating self-reinforcing cycles of artificial intelligence capability
   enhancement. This research demonstrates how artificial intelligence
   capabilities, particularly generative pre-trained transformers, create

   develop the architectural proposal, we incorporated the results of the
   student survey along with insights gained from analyzing the
   architectures of other learning platforms. The proposed architecture is

   Qualitative Semistructured Interview Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {27},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Background: With the rapid development and iteration of generative
   artificial intelligence, the growing popularity of such groundbreaking
   tools among nurse researchers, represented by ChatGPT (OpenAI), is
   receiving passionate debate and intrigue. Although there has been
   qualitative research on generative artificial intelligence in other
   fields, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of nurse
   researchers; this study seeks to report on the topic. Objective: This
   study aimed to describe the experiences and perceptions of generative
   artificial intelligence among Chinese nurse researchers, as well as
   provide a reference for the application of generative artificial
   intelligence in nursing research in the future. Methods: Semistructured
   interviews were used to collect data in this qualitative study.
   Researchers mainly conducted interviews on the cognition, experience,
   and future expectations of nurse researchers regarding the use of
   generative artificial intelligence. Twenty-seven nurse researchers were
   included in the study. Through purposive sampling and snowball sampling,
   there were 7 nursing faculty researchers, 10 nursing graduate students,
   and 10 clinical nurse researchers. Data were analyzed using inductive
   content analysis. Results: Five themes and 12 subthemes were categorized
   from 27 original interview documents as follows: (1) diverse reflections
   on human-machine symbiosis, which includes the interplay between
   substitution and assistance, researchers shaping the potential of
   generative artificial intelligence, and acceptance of generative
   artificial intelligence with alacrity; (2) multiple factors of the usage
   experience, including individual characteristics and various usage
   scenarios; (3) research paradigm reshaping in the infancy stage, which
   involves full-process groundbreaking assistive tools and emergence of
   new research paths; (4) application risks of generative artificial
   intelligence, including intrinsic limitations of generative artificial
   intelligence and academic integrity and medical ethics; and (5) the
   co-improvement of technology and literacy, which concerns reinforcement
   needs for generative artificial intelligence literacy, development of
   nursing research generative artificial intelligence and urgent need for
   artificial intelligence-generated content detection tools. In this
   context, the first 4 themes form the rocket of the human-machine
   symbiosis journey. Only when humans fully leverage the advantages of
   machines (generative artificial intelligence) and overcome their
   shortcomings can this human-machine symbiosis journey reach the correct
   future direction (fifth theme). Conclusions: This study explored the
   experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers interacting with
   generative artificial intelligence, which was a ``symbiotic journey{''}
   full of twists and turns, and provides a reference and basis for
   achieving harmonious coexistence between nurse researchers and
   generative artificial intelligence in the future. Nurse researchers,
   policy makers, and application developers can use the conclusions of
   this study to further promote the application of generative artificial
   intelligence in nursing research, policy making, and product
   development.},

Title = {I Can't Take This Anymore! Understanding the Relationship Between
   Personality Traits and Tolerance of Generative AI Hallucinations},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {3864-3876},
Abstract = {The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has increased
   drastically in recent years, offering transformative potential in
   creativity, productivity, and decision-making across various domains.
   However, concerns are growing among practitioners and academics about
   its tendency to produce inaccurate or nonsensical outputs-a phenomenon
   known as generative AI hallucinations. While scholars have begun
   exploring this phenomenon, most of the existing research focuses on
   technical issues and solutions. This research takes a behavioral
   approach to examine the association between individual personality
   traits and tolerance of generative AI hallucinations. Drawing on error
   management theory and the big five personality traits, we examine how
   individuals with different personality traits tolerate generative AI
   hallucinations. The study contributes to calls from management journals
   to investigate the challenges associated with generative AI use. Our
   findings provide important theoretical implications and offer actionable
   insights for engineering managers seeking to implement generative AI.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},

Pages = {335-348},
Abstract = {Despite the transformative potential of generative artificial
   intelligence (AI) systems within enterprise digital platforms, there
   still exist gaps in understanding the challenges and strategies
   associated with their adoption. Addressing this pressing issue, this
   article draws upon institutional theory to delve into the drivers
   influencing firms' adoption of generative AI within their enterprise
   digital platforms. Leveraging survey data collected from 328 firms that
   have implemented digital platforms to support their business operations,
   we find that institutional pressures positively influence generative AI
   adoption within their enterprise digital platforms. Furthermore, we
   identify salient moderating effects of policy uncertainty and innovative
   culture in shaping the relationships. Our research findings make a
   substantial contribution to AI literature by illuminating the potential
   challenges and strategies toward generative AI adoption as well as
   reassessing the application of institutional theory within the digital

Abstract = {Education is experiencing a paradigm shift, evolving from traditional
   learning methods to computer-tool-based education, and now toward the
   integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence. While classical
   methods offer structured and standardized learning, they often do not
   fully address individual learner needs and accessibility. The rise of
   digital technologies introduced adaptive learning platforms, online
   classrooms, and interactive educational tools, expanding the reach and
   flexibility of educational systems. Today, Generative Artificial
   Intelligence tools are redefining the education landscape by
   personalized learning experiences, automating content generation, and
   providing real-time feedback. Intelligent tutoring systems and
   personalized assessments empower students with customized learning
   pathways that enhance engagement and academic performance. This paper
   presents a meta-survey that systematically examines the role of
   Generative Artificial Intelligence in education, following PRISMA
   guidelines to analyze trends, frameworks, and research outcomes across a
   curated body of academic literature. Special attention is given to the
   emergence of commercial Generative Artificial Intelligence tools, which
   are increasingly embedded in learning environments. A structured
   comparison framework and research questions guide the review, offering
   insights into how Generative Artificial Intelligence technologies are
   shaping pedagogical practices, influencing assessment, and raising new
   ethical and technical challenges. The paper also explores future
   directions, highlighting how Generative Artificial Intelligence is
   driving the emergence of new learning models.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {161},

Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Since, Artificial Intelligence is highly developing and concatenating
   into several domains, cybersecurity is an important field of delivering
   both the advantages and disadvantages. In addition to this, Artificial
   Intelligence is applied in a wide variety of applications like
   healthcare sector, content creation and entertainment and financial
   industries. Therefore, this work finds the efficiency of Artificial
   Intelligence -oriented cybersecurity metrics in succeeding the digital
   environment over elevating cyber threats. Here, the developed models
   consist of two different stages while implementing the model. In the
   first stage, the essential dataset is assembled from the benchmark data
   source. These datasets are assembled by using Generative Artificial
   Intelligence (Gen Artificial Intelligence networks). Consequently, the
   raw data is given as an input to Conditional Hybrid Network for
   cybersecurity enhancement. Further, the Transformer-based Conditional
   Variational Autoencoders with Spatialtemporal Attention are designed for
   feature extraction that is subjected to the Conditional Generative
   Adversarial Network for classifying the cyber attacks. Henceforth, the
   developed network is evaluated and designed with multiple measures.
   Comparing baseline models, the suggested network obtains higher
   performance for developing security over cyber networks.},

Abstract = {The area of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly
   expanding, as seen by the regular release of new models and applications
   every few months. While these GenAI models have impressive capabilities,
   their computational intensity has presented issues, especially in
   applications demanding low latency. Hence, substantial research is being
   conducted to develop ways to scale down these models so that they may be
   used for on-device computing on edge devices. Examining successful
   examples of GenAI models implemented on mobile devices with minimum
   latency becomes critical in understanding the practical consequences of
   these breakthroughs. Notable instances, such as the deployment of
   diffusion-based GenAI models on flagship smartphones like Samsung S23
   Ultra and iPhone 14, demonstrate the possibility and promise of bringing
   GenAI applications to consumers' fingertips. We further analyze and find
   out the approaches and strategies that make these on-device deployments

Pages = {94893-94909},
Abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) with virtual
   reality (VR) is reshaping how immersive environments are designed,
   personalized, and experienced. Unlike traditional VR systems that rely
   on static and pre-scripted content, Generative VR leverages AI-driven
   content generation, multimodal interaction, and contextual adaptation to
   create dynamic virtual spaces. This paper presents a comprehensive
   survey of the core components, applications, and challenges associated
   with Generative VR. It explores its transformative impact across
   education, healthcare, industrial training, entertainment, and emerging
   fields such as environmental conservation and virtual tourism. While
   Generative VR enhances user engagement and realism, it also introduces
   critical challenges, including computational scalability, ethical
   concerns, AI explainability, and real-time performance constraints. The
   paper further identifies key research gaps and future directions, such
   as AI-driven multi-user collaboration, cognitive load management, and
   cross-domain interoperability. By addressing these challenges and
   advancing the integration of AI with VR, Generative VR has the potential
   to reshape human-computer interaction, unlocking new possibilities for

Abstract = {This research explores users' preferences for human versus Generative

   human providers in terms of perceived information quality, usage
   intention, and advocacy intentions. Study 2 demonstrates that this
   preference exists only in pre-visit stages, with no differences for
   on-site information search (except in willingness to follow

   post positive reviews about human providers pre-visit, with no
   difference on-site. While previous research has conceptually explored
   ChatGPT's role in travel decision-making, our empirical evidence shows
   that acceptance and advocacy toward Generative Artificial Intelligence

Abstract = {In addition to tapping data from users' behavioral surplus, by drawing
   on generative adversarial networks, data for artificial intelligence is
   now increasingly being generated through artificial intelligence. With
   this new method of producing data synthetically, the data economy is not
   only shifting from ``data collection{''} to ``data generation.{''}
   Synthetic data is also being employed to address some of the most
   pressing ethical concerns around artificial intelligence. It thereby
   comes with the sociotechnical imaginary that social problems can be cut
   out of artificial intelligence, separating training data from real
   persons. In response to this technical solutionism, this commentary aims
   to initiate a critical debate about synthetic data that goes beyond
   misuse scenarios such as the use of generative adversarial networks to
   create deep fakes or dark patterns. Instead, on a more general level, we
   seek to complicate the idea of ``solving,{''} i.e., ``closing{''} and
   thus ``silencing{''} the ethico-political debates for which synthetic
   data is supposed to be a solution by showing how synthetic data itself
   is political. Drawing on the complex connections between recent uses of
   synthetic data and public debates about artificial intelligence, we
   therefore propose to consider and analyze synthetic data not only as a
   technical device but as a discursive one as well. To this end, we shed
   light on their relationship to three pillars that we see associated with
   them (a) algorithmic bias, (b) privacy, (c) platform economy.},

Abstract = {This article examines journalists' perspectives on the use of Generative
   Artificial Intelligence in their journalism practices in T \&
   uuml;rkiye. This study analyzes the integration of Generative Artificial
   Intelligence tools in Turkish newsrooms, explores journalists' attitudes
   toward these technologies, and investigates the ethical dilemmas and
   their impact on journalism practices and the news production process.
   Data from in-depth interviews with 26 journalists from various media
   organizations in T \& uuml;rkiye were analyzed using thematic analysis.
   The findings indicate that although Generative Artificial Intelligence
   tools save considerable time on journalism tasks such as translation,
   summarization, and fact-checking, they have not significantly reduced
   journalists' overall workload. Additionally, the use of Generative
   Artificial Intelligence tools in reporting on sensitive, complex issues
   (e.g. foreign news, women's and children's rights) raises serious
   ethical concerns, particularly regarding bias in news coverage. It also
   seems that Generative Artificial Intelligence tools are failing to
   replace the essential human qualities of emotion, empathy, and
   contextual understanding that journalists bring to their work. Finally,
   the Integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence into journalism is
   viewed both as an opportunity and a threat to various journalistic
   roles, such as online journalism and editing, yet it is perceived as
   inevitable in the journalism profession, much like in many other fields.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence has sparked a widespread public
   discourse, oscillating between utopian and dystopian visions about a
   technologically determined near future. In this article, we employ the
   concept of AI imaginary to examine the diverse and contested visions of

   Utilising Cave and Dihal's conceptual framework, we develop a
   quantitative methodology to map the utopian and dystopian narratives of
   generative artificial intelligence. Analysing newspapers from the United
   Kingdom, the United States, China and India, we uncover significant
   differences in media representations through content analysis and
   computational topic modelling. Findings reveal a dystopian perspective
   in the United Kingdom and the United States, focusing on challenges such
   as workforce displacement and misinformation, whereas in China and
   India, the narrative is more utopian, highlighting potential benefits
   for technological leadership, economic growth and social advancement.
   Our study provides methodological and conceptual tools for a comparative
   examination of the sociotechnical imaginaries of generative artificial

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC), particularly diffusion
   models as a key component of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI),
   are transforming smart design and manufacturing in the interplay of
   Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. This paper analyzes the applications of
   diffusion models in smart design and manufacturing, focusing on three
   key pillars: diffusion-driven generative design, smart control, and
   fault diagnosis. Diffusion models enhance manufacturing system
   flexibility, resilience, and sustainability through their applications
   as generative design engines, intelligent controllers for adaptive
   manufacturing processes, and predictive tools for fault diagnosis. This
   study provides a comprehensive review of the current state of diffusion
   model-driven smart design and manufacturing. It analyzes key challenges
   such as model efficiency, data dependency, and system integration, while
   providing a constructive perspective on potential solutions. This paper
   also integrates Industry 5.0 considerations by connecting the
   applications and technical solutions to the core values of
   human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience. It concludes by
   emphasizing the necessity of continuous refinement of diffusion models
   and interdisciplinary research to integrate them into smart design and

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence and their derived Generative technologies are
   playing a crucial role in many applications that involve an active
   collaboration among machine assistants and human users. That is the case
   for User Experience courses that allowed students and instructors work
   together with Generative Artificial Intelligence tools to produce a
   collaborative design. The main purpose of this research consisted in
   reviewing several stages in design tasks that could take advantage of
   Artificial Intelligence tools by boosting a prompt-based conversation
   among instructors and students. Results obtained through the use of
   these tools demonstrated their huge potential in facilitating
   co-creative tasks. In this context, a first cohort of students was able
   to collaborate on the ideation of User Experience projects by exchanging
   prompts to define persona profiles and checking their suitability. A
   second cohort was involved in the joint assessment of testing mockups
   related to the design of three website proposals. Certain barriers were
   identified in the application of these Generative tools to implement Web
   development tasks. Anyway, Generative Artificial Intelligence
   technologies have enabled new instructional scenarios supporting the
   elaboration and evaluation of User Experience courses.},

Abstract = {Traditional nursing and health education design courses usually only
   transfer knowledge via lectures, and lack interaction, drills and
   personalized feedback. However, the development and widespread adoption
   of generative artificial intelligence via the ChatGPT system presents an
   opportunity to address these issues. Some CIDI model-based ChatGPT
   systems have been developed, but how to effectively apply these
   technologies in nursing education design courses remains a challenging
   problem for researchers. In order to explore the application mode and
   effect of generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT technology in
   nursing education, this study integrated generative artificial
   intelligence via the ChatGPT system into the teaching activities of
   nursing and health education design courses, and used computers as
   learning tools to guide learners to learn nursing and health knowledge.
   At the same time, two classes of nursing undergraduates were recruited
   to conduct a quasi-experiment. One of the classes was the experimental
   group, which used the generative artificial intelligence via the ChatGPT
   system for learning; the other class was the control group, which used
   traditional teaching methods for learning. By analyzing learners'
   learning efficiency and learning satisfaction, we obtained results about
   the application effect of generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT
   technology in a nursing education design course. According to the
   experimental results, the generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT
   system effectively improved learners' critical thinking ability, problem
   solving, and learning enjoyment. These results indicate that the
   generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT system has great
   potential in nursing education design courses, and can improve the

Abstract = {This study aims to examine how generative artificial intelligence
   adoption and perceived artificial intelligence capacities influence
   sustainability-oriented entrepreneurial intentions through psychological
   mechanisms, including perceived desirability and feasibility. Despite
   growing research interest in sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship,
   the role of technological enablers, particularly artificial
   intelligence, in shaping entrepreneurial intentions has been
   underexplored. To achieve this objective, an advanced
   approach-polynomial regression with response surface analysis-was
   employed to test the formulated hypotheses using data from 385
   participants. The study further shows that sustainability-oriented
   entrepreneurial intentions improve significantly when perceived
   desirability and feasibility are aligned but remain unaffected by
   misalignment. Generative artificial intelligence adoption and perceived
   artificial intelligence capacities are shown to directly and indirectly
   enhance entrepreneurial intentions through perceived desirability and
   feasibility, highlighting the dual role of artificial intelligence as a
   practical enabler and psychological motivator. These findings contribute
   to the extent of entrepreneurial literature by indicating how artificial
   intelligence technologies foster sustainability-oriented
   entrepreneurship. Moreover, these findings provide valuable insights for
   policymakers, educators, and organizations by demonstrating how
   artificial intelligence can be leveraged to promote sustainable
   innovation and entrepreneurship. By integrating artificial intelligence

   better support the development of sustainability-oriented entrepreneurs

Journal = {PUBLIC PERFORMANCE \& MANAGEMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 31},
Abstract = {Today, various types of artificial intelligence (AI) are emerging as
   potential information and communication technologies (ICTs) to be
   integrated into the workplace. Recent work focuses on the potential
   impacts of AI on public service delivery (Battaglini et al., 2022;
   Meijer \& Wessels, 2019) and bureaucratic decision-making (Bullock,
   2019; Young et al., 2019). Yet little is understood regarding public
   employees-generative AI interactions and how these interactions affect
   work outcomes. Street-level bureaucrats make decisions with considerable
   discretion, while they interact with the public (Lipsky, 1980). While AI
   can be utilized as a tool by street-level bureaucrats, it also may
   eliminate human roles and stand in as an ``artificial bureaucrat{''}
   (Bullock \& Kim, 2020). The integration of generative AI may shape
   employees' role identities, which in turn affect their psychosocial
   outcomes. We develop a theoretical framework that investigates how
   human-generative- AI interactions affect street-level bureaucrats' work
   outcomes. The framework focuses on two main components: (1) the extent
   to which generative AI takes part at work; and (2) how human-generative
   AI interactions shape street-level bureaucrats role identity and their
   psychosocial outcomes. We integrate literature about workplace identity
   and job demands-resources theory to provide a set of propositions that
   can be applied in public organizations.},

Pages = {293-308},
Abstract = {The article delves into the symbiotic relationship between
   sociosemiotics and AI research, specifically focusing on Generative
   Artificial Intelligences (GenAI). As GenAI gain traction in verbal and
   iconic creation, in the context of various cultural and communication
   theories, sociosemiotics emerges as a key framework for understanding
   these processes. The article addresses questions such as: How have the
   relationships between AI research and sociosemiotics evolved? How can
   sociosemiotics contribute to the understanding of GenAI? If Umberto Eco
   (1986) distinguished between general semiotics and specific (or applied)
   semiotics, what would be the main characteristics of a semiotics of
   Generative AI? In this context, the article's objectives encompass three
   dimensions: 1) Tracing the intertwined evolution of sociosemiotics and
   AI research over 75 years, spotlighting the textual and sociosemiotics
   contributions; 2) Proposing a series of possible sociosemiotic
   interventions in the realm of GenAI; and 3) Reflecting on the emergence
   of an applied semiotics of GenAI. Ultimately, the article encapsulates
   the intricate interplay between sociosemiotics and GenAI, paving the way
   for novel insights into AI's semiotic foundations and its multifaceted
   implications in contemporary digital creation.},

Abstract = {The fundamental goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to mimic the
   core cognitive activities of human. Despite tremendous success in the AI
   research, most of existing methods have only single-cognitive ability.
   To overcome this limitation and take a solid step towards artificial
   general intelligence (AGI), we develop a foundation model pre-trained
   with huge multimodal data, which can be quickly adapted for various
   downstream cognitive tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose to
   pre-train our foundation model by self-supervised learning with weak
   semantic correlation data crawled from the Internet and show that
   promising results can be obtained on a wide range of downstream tasks.
   Particularly, with the developed model-interpretability tools, we
   demonstrate that strong imagination ability is now possessed by our
   foundation model. We believe that our work makes a transformative stride
   towards AGI, from our common practice of ``weak or narrow AI{''} to that
   of ``strong or generalized AI{''}.
   Artificial intelligence approaches inspired by human cognitive function
   have usually single learned ability. The authors propose a multimodal
   foundation model that demonstrates the cross-domain learning and
   adaptation for broad range of downstream cognitive tasks.},

   and for this reason are called black box models, most notably deep
   learning methods. However, it has been realized that this constitutes
   severe problems for a number of fields including the health sciences and
   criminal justice and arguments have been brought forward in favor of an
   explainable AI (XAI). In this paper, we do not assume the usual
   perspective presenting XAI as it should be, but rather provide a
   discussion what XAIcan be. The difference is that we do not present
   wishful thinking but reality grounded properties in relation to a
   scientific theory beyond physics. This article is categorized under:

Abstract = {Despite enormous progress in machine learning, artificial neural
   networks still lag behind brains in their ability to generalize to new
   situations. Given identical training data, differences in generalization
   are caused by many defining features of a learning algorithm, such as
   network architecture and learning rule. Their joint effect, called
   ``inductive bias,'' determines how well any learning algorithm-or
   brain-generalizes: robust generalization needs good inductive biases.
   Artificial networks use rather nonspecific biases and often latch onto
   patterns that are only informative about the statistics of the training
   data but may not generalize to different scenarios. Brains, on the other
   hand, generalize across comparatively drastic changes in the sensory
   input all the time. We highlight some shortcomings of state-of-the-art
   learning algorithms compared to biological brains and discuss several
   ideas about how neuroscience can guide the quest for better inductive
   biases by providing useful constraints on representations and network
   architecture.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence are encouraging governments
   and corporations to deploy AI in high-stakes settings including driving
   cars autonomously, managing the power grid, trading on stock exchanges,
   and controlling autonomous weapons systems. Such applications require AI
   methods to be robust to both the known unknowns (those uncertain aspects
   of the world about which the computer can reason explicitly) and the
   unknown unknowns (those aspects of the world that are not captured by
   the system's models). This article discusses recent progress in AI and
   then describes eight ideas related to robustness that are being pursued
   within the AI research community. While these ideas are a start, we need
   to devote more attention to the challenges of dealing with the known and
   unknown unknowns. These issues are fascinating, because they touch on
   the fundamental question of how finite systems can survive and thrive in
   a complex and dangerous world.},

Abstract = {All disciplines, including nursing, may be experiencing significant
   changes with the advent of free, publicly available generative
   artificial intelligence tools. Recent research has shown the difficulty
   in distinguishing artificial intelligence-generated text from content
   that is written by humans, thereby increasing the probability for
   unverified information shared in scholarly works. The purpose of this
   study was to determine the extent of generative artificial intelligence
   usage in published nursing articles. The Dimensions database was used to
   collect articles with at least one appearance of words and phrases
   associated with generative artificial intelligence. These articles were
   then searched for words or phrases known to be disproportionately
   associated with large language model-based generative artificial
   intelligence. Several nouns, verbs, adverbs, and phrases had remarkable
   increases in appearance starting in 2023, suggesting use of generative
   artificial intelligence. Nurses, authors, reviewers, and editors will
   likely encounter generative artificial intelligence in their work.
   Although these sophisticated and emerging tools are promising, we must
   continue to work toward developing ways to verify accuracy of their
   content, develop policies that insist on transparent use, and safeguard
   consumers of the evidence they generate.},

Abstract = {Systematic review is a powerful tool for disseminating the findings of
   research, particularly in applied linguistics where we hope to provide
   insights for practising language teachers. Yet, systematic review is
   also often prohibitively time-consuming, particularly for small,
   underfunded teams or solo researchers. In this study, we explore the use
   of generative artificial intelligence to ease the burden of screening
   and organising papers. Our findings suggest that AI excels in some
   tasks, particularly when those tasks involve explicitly stated
   information, and struggles in others, particularly when information is
   more implicit. A comparison of generative artificial intelligence for
   filtering papers with ASReview, a popular non-generative tool, reveals
   trade-offs, with Generative AI being replicable and more efficient, but
   with concerns about accuracy. We conclude that generative artificial
   intelligence can be a useful tool for systematic review but requires
   rigorous validation before use. We conclude by emphasising the
   importance of testing AI for systematic review tasks and exploring how
   this can practically be achieved.},

Abstract = {Machine learned generative design is an extension of the generative
   design process, addressing its inherent limitations, particularly those
   of interoperability. The proposed approach uses machine learning -based
   surrogate models, trained on computational model data, to replicate
   design evaluations and integrate them into a common environment. In this
   way, design alternatives can be generated and tested that satisfy all
   design requirements and considerations. The effectiveness of this
   approach is demonstrated by the design and optimisation of the enclosure
   structure for the New Robotic Telescope. Its complexity is characterised
   by multiple operating states that the enclosure can assume, in
   particular the closed state and the opening/closing state, each of which
   has a different structural behaviour. Using our approach, the results
   from each state were replicated with machine learning models and
   combined into a single evaluation model. This resulted in finding
   multiple solutions that outperformed the benchmark design. The results
   demonstrate not only the success of our method over conventional
   strategies, but also highlight its potential to redefine future design
   optimisation processes.},

Abstract = {Neural generative models can be used to learn complex probability
   distributions from data, to sample from them, and to produce probability
   density estimates. We propose a computational framework for developing
   neural generative models inspired by the theory of predictive processing
   in the brain. According to predictive processing theory, the neurons in
   the brain form a hierarchy in which neurons in one level form
   expectations about sensory inputs from another level. These neurons
   update their local models based on differences between their
   expectations and the observed signals. In a similar way, artificial
   neurons in our generative models predict what neighboring neurons will
   do, and adjust their parameters based on how well the predictions
   matched reality. In this work, we show that the neural generative models
   learned within our framework perform well in practice across several
   benchmark datasets and metrics and either remain competitive with or
   significantly outperform other generative models with similar
   functionality (such as the variational auto-encoder).
   Brain-inspired neural generative models can be designed to learn complex

Abstract = {In less than one year from its launch, the chatbot ChatGPT has captured
   widespread public attention, thanks to its ease of use and remarkable

   some key stakeholders on the issues of above and the regulation of the
   design and use of such technologies, examining these perspectives
   through the lenses of ``Digital Constitutionalism{''}. Particularly,
   this paper will emphasise the role that civil society can play in such
   dynamics (Section 3). Subsequently, it will further promote an active
   and forward-looking approach in addressing the looming threats these and
   other AI-based technologies could pose to fundamental rights and society
   as a whole (Section 4). As we already approach the next AI era without
   even noticing, the question worth asking ourselves is: ``What will

Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can synthesize images with the
   same distribution as the training dataset through random vectors.
   However, there is still no proper way to explain the generation rules in
   the generator and modify those rules. Although there have been some
   works on rewriting the rules in generative models in recent years, these
   works mainly focus on rewriting the rules between the patterns it has
   already learned. In this paper, we cast the problem of rewriting as
   rewriting the rule in the generator with out-of-domain patterns. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first time this problem has been
   investigated. To address this problem, we propose the Re-Generator
   framework. Specifically, our method projects out-of-domain images into
   the feature space of a specific layer in the generator and designs a
   mechanism to enable the generator to decode that feature back to the
   original image as possible. Besides that, we also suggest viewing
   multiple layers of the model as nonlinearity associative memory and
   design a rewriting strategy with better performance based on this.
   Finally, the results of the experiments on various generative models in
   multiple datasets show that our method can effectively use the patterns
   that the model has never seen before as rules for rewriting.},

   as a tool for `pedagogical enhancement', `specialised training and

   and development', and as an `interdisciplinary learning tool'. Key gaps
   highlighted include a paucity of research and discussions on GenAI in

Title = {A comprehensive survey and analysis of generative models in machine
   learning},
Journal = {COMPUTER SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Generative models have been in existence for many decades. In the field
   of machine learning, we come across many scenarios when directly
   learning a target is intractable through discriminative models, and in
   such cases the joint distribution of the target and the training data is
   approximated and generated. These generative models help us better
   represent or model a set of data by generating data in the form of
   Markov chains or simply employing a generative iterative process to do
   the same. With the recent innovation of Generative Adversarial Networks
   (GANs), it is now possible to make use of AI to generate pieces of art,
   music, etc. with a high extent of realism. In this paper, we review and
   analyse critically all the generative models, namely Gaussian Mixture
   Models (GMM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Latent Dirichlet Allocation
   (LDA), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), Deep Belief Networks (DBN),
   Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), and GANs. We study their algorithms and
   implement each of the models to provide the reader some insights on
   which generative model to pick from while dealing with a problem. We
   also provide some noteworthy contributions done in the past to these
   models from the literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {29},
Pages = {17-23},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the history of the quest for human-level artificial intelligence, a
   number of rival paradigms have vied for supremacy. Symbolic artificial
   intelligence was dominant for much of the 20th century, but currently a
   connectionist paradigm is in the ascendant, namely machine learning with
   deep neural networks. However, both paradigms have strengths and
   weaknesses, and a significant challenge for the field today is to effect
   a reconciliation. A central tenet of the symbolic paradigm is that
   intelligence results from the manipulation of abstract compositional
   representations whose elements stand for objects and relations. If this
   is correct, then a key objective for deep learning is to develop
   architectures capable of discovering objects and relations in raw data,
   and learning how to represent them in ways that are useful for
   downstream processing. This short review highlights recent progress in
   this direction.},

Abstract = {Among the many types of deep models, deep generative models (DGMs)
   provide a solution to the important problem of unsupervised and
   semi-supervised learning. However, training DGMs requires more skill,
   experience, and know-how because their training is more complex than
   other types of deep models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
   We develop a visual analytics approach for better understanding and
   diagnosing the training process of a DGM. To help experts understand the
   overall training process, we first extract a large amount of time series
   data that represents training dynamics (e.g., activation changes over
   time). A blue-noise polyline sampling scheme is then introduced to
   select time series samples, which can both preserve outliers and reduce
   visual clutter. To further investigate the root cause of a failed
   training process; we propose a credit assignment algorithm that
   indicates how other neurons contribute to the output of the neuron
   causing the training failure. Two case studies are conducted with
   machine learning experts to demonstrate how our approach helps
   understand and diagnose the training processes of DGMs. We also show how
   our approach can be directly used to analyze other types of deep models
   such as CNNs.},

Title = {Asymmetric deep generative models},
Journal = {NEUROCOMPUTING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {241},
Pages = {90-96},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Amortized variational inference, whereby the inferred latent variable
   posterior distributions are parameterized by means of neural network
   functions, has invigorated a new wave of innovation in the field of
   generative latent variable modeling, giving rise to the family of deep
   generative models (DGMs). Existing DGM formulations are based on the
   assumption of a symmetric Gaussian posterior over the model latent
   variables. This assumption, although mathematically convenient, can be
   well-expected to undermine the eventually obtained representation power,
   as it imposes apparent expressiveness limitations. Indeed, it has been
   recently shown that even some moderate increase in the latent variable
   posterior expressiveness, obtained by introducing an additional level of
   dependencies upon auxiliary (Gaussian) latent variables, can result in
   significant performance improvements in the context of semi-supervised
   learning tasks. Inspired from these advances, in this paper we examine
   whether a more potent increase in the expressiveness and representation
   power of modern DGMs can be achieved by completely relaxing their
   typical symmetric (Gaussian) latent variable posterior assumptions:
   Specifically, we consider DGMs with asymmetric posteriors, formulated as
   restricted multivariate skew-Normal (rMSN) distributions. We derive an
   efficient amortized variational inference algorithm for the proposed
   model, and exhibit its superiority over the current state-of-the-art in
   several semi-supervised learning benchmarks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Absract Deep learning is currently the most prominent and widely
   successful method in artificial intelligence. Despite having played an
   active role in earlier artificial intelligence and neural network
   research, philosophers have been largely silent on this technology so
   far. This is remarkable, given that deep learning neural networks have
   blown past predicted upper limits on artificial intelligence
   performance-recognizing complex objects in natural photographs and
   defeating world champions in strategy games as complex as Go and
   chess-yet there remains no universally accepted explanation as to why
   they work so well. This article provides an introduction to these
   networks as well as an opinionated guidebook on the philosophical
   significance of their structure and achievements. It argues that deep
   learning neural networks differ importantly in their structure and
   mathematical properties from the shallower neural networks that were the
   subject of so much philosophical reflection in the 1980s and 1990s. The
   article then explores several different explanations for their success
   and ends by proposing three areas of inquiry that would benefit from
   future engagement by philosophers of mind and science.},

   different agents. Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve
   both the speed and quality of their output, while the most experienced

   in quality. We also find evidence that AI assistance facilitates worker
   learning and improves English fluency, particularly among international
   agents. While AI systems improve with more training data, we find that
   the gains from AI adoption are largest for moderately rare problems,
   where human agents have less baseline experience but the system still

Abstract = {Although machine learning has been successful in recent years and is
   increasingly being deployed in the sciences, enterprises or

   philosophy of mathematics and machine learning. The present contribution
   addresses the resulting lack of conceptual tools for an epistemological
   discussion of machine learning by conceiving of deep learning networks
   as `judging machines' and using the Kantian analysis of judgments for
   specifying the type of judgment they are capable of. At the center of
   the argument is the fact that the functionality of deep learning
   networks is established by training and cannot be explained and
   justified by reference to a predefined rule-based procedure. Instead,
   the computational process of a deep learning network is barely
   explainable and needs further justification, as is shown in reference to
   the current research literature. Thus, it requires a new form of
   justification, that is to be specified with the help of Kant's
   epistemology.},

Abstract = {In this paper we discuss what we believe to be one of the most important

   between humans and AI systems could exist. That would require
   reciprocity, which is beyond the reach of near-future AI systems.
   Rather, we defend the claim that social AIs should be programmed to
   behave in a manner thatmimicsa sufficient number of aspects of proper
   friendship. We call this ``as-if friendship{''}. The main reason for why
   we believe that `as if friendship' is an improvement on the current,
   highly submissive behavior displayed by AIs is the negative effects the
   latter can have on humans. We defend this view partly on virtue ethical
   grounds and we argue that the virtue-based approach to AI ethics

   improvement on the traditional ``value alignment{''} approach.},

Abstract = {Theoretical results suggest that in order to learn the kind of

   Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task,

   the promises and challenges of GenAI and offer a roadmap for deploying
   the technology. We then introduce a sailing metaphor that reveals key
   strategic dimensions for GenAI deployment: competency of employees,
   effective leadership and work values, organizational culture,
   collaboration and cooperation, and relationships with third parties. We
   conclude with practical recommendations for successfully deploying GenAI
   in SMEs. (c) 2024 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

Abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs), first published in 2014, are
   among the most important concepts in modern artificial intelligence
   (AI). Bridging deep learning and game theory, GANs are used to generate

   multiple GANs with reinforcement learning (RL) have been successfully
   applied in pharmacology for de novo molecular design. Those techniques
   aim at a more efficient use of the data and a better exploration of the
   chemical space. We review recent advances for the generation of novel
   molecules with desired properties with a focus on the applications of
   GANs, RL, and related techniques. We also discuss the current

Title = {Addressing the risks of generative AI for the judiciary: The
   accountability framework(s) under the EU AI Act},
Journal = {COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {55},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The rapid advancements in natural language processing, particularly the
   development of generative large language models (LLMs), have renewed
   interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for judicial
   decision-making. While these technological breakthroughs present new
   possibilities for legal automation, they also raise concerns about
   over-reliance and automation bias. Drawing insights from the COMPAS
   case, this paper examines the implications of deploying generative LLMs
   in the judicial domain. It identifies the persistent factors that
   contributed to an accountability gap when AI systems were previously
   used for judicial decision-making. To address these risks, the paper
   analyses the relevant provisions of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act,
   outlining a comprehensive accountability framework based on the
   regulation's risk-based approach. The paper concludes that the
   successful integration of generative LLMs in judicial decision-making
   requires a holistic approach addressing cognitive biases. By emphasising
   shared responsibility and the imperative of AI literacy across the AI
   value chain, the regulatory framework can help mitigate the risks of
   automation bias and preserve the rule of law.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The speckle is a granular undesired pattern present in
   Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Despeckling has been an active
   field of research during the last decades, with approaches from local
   filters to non-local filters that calculate the new value of a pixel
   according to characteristics of other pixels that are not close, the
   more advanced paradigms based on deep learning, and the newer based on
   generative artificial intelligence. For the latter, it is necessary to
   have a large enough labeled dataset for training and validation. In this
   study, we propose using a dataset designed entirely from actual SAR
   imagery, calculated by multitemporal fusion operations to generate a
   ground truth reference, which will yield the models to be trained with
   the actual speckle patterns in the noisy images. Then, a comparative
   analysis of the impacts of including the generative capacity in the
   models is performed through visual and quantitative assessment. From the
   findings, it is concluded that the use of generative artificial
   intelligence with actual speckle exhibits notable efficiency compared to
   other approaches, which makes this a promising path for research in the
   context of SAR imagery.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence in medical imaging has grown rapidly in the past
   decade, driven by advances in deep learning and widespread access to
   computing resources. Applications cover diverse imaging modalities,
   including those based on electromagnetic radiation (e.g., X-rays),
   subatomic particles (e.g., nuclear imaging), and acoustic waves
   (ultrasound). Each modality features and limitations are defined by its
   underlying physics. However, many artificial intelligence practitioners
   lack a solid understanding of the physical principles involved in
   medical image acquisition. This gap hinders leveraging the full
   potential of deep learning, as incorporating physics knowledge into
   artificial intelligence systems promotes trustworthiness, especially in
   limited data scenarios. This work reviews the fundamental physical

Abstract = {ChatGPT and its variants that use generative artificial intelligence
   (AI) models have rapidly become a focal point in academic and media
   discussions about their potential benefits and drawbacks across various
   sectors of the economy, democracy, society, and environment. It remains
   unclear whether these technologies result in job displacement or
   creation, or if they merely shift human labour by generating new,
   potentially trivial or practically irrelevant, information and
   decisions. According to the CEO of ChatGPT, the potential impact of this
   new family of AI technology could be as big as ``the printing press{''},
   with significant implications for employment, stakeholder relationships,
   business models, and academic research, and its full consequences are
   largely undiscovered and uncertain. The introduction of more advanced

   ChatGPT, has ramped up the ``AI arms race{''}, creating continuing
   uncertainty for workers, expanding their business applications, while
   heightening risks related to well-being, bias, misinformation, context
   insensitivity, privacy issues, ethical dilemmas, and security. Given
   these developments, this perspectives editorial offers a collection of
   perspectives and research pathways to extend HRM scholarship in the

Abstract = {Introduction Generative Artificial Intelligence has made significant
   impacts in many fields, including computational cognitive modeling of
   decision making, although these applications have not yet been
   theoretically related to each other. This work introduces a
   categorization of applications of Generative Artificial Intelligence to
   cognitive models of decision making.Methods This categorization is used
   to compare the existing literature and to provide insight into the
   design of an ablation study to evaluate our proposed model in three
   experimental paradigms. These experiments used for model comparison
   involve modeling human learning and decision making based on both visual
   information and natural language, in tasks that vary in realism and
   complexity. This comparison of applications takes as its basis
   Instance-Based Learning Theory, a theory of experiential decision making
   from which many models have emerged and been applied to a variety of
   domains and applications.Results The best performing model from the
   ablation we performed used a generative model to both create memory
   representations as well as predict participant actions. The results of
   this comparison demonstrates the importance of generative models in both
   forming memories and predicting actions in decision-modeling
   research.Discussion In this work, we present a model that integrates
   generative and cognitive models, using a variety of stimuli,
   applications, and training methods. These results can provide guidelines

   International Regulatory Approaches},
Journal = {PROBLEMY EKOROZWOJU},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) offers unprecedented
   opportunities for technological innovation and societal advancement,
   while also posing significant risks and challenges. Generative
   Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) - exemplified by models such as
   ChatGPT - relies heavily on deep learning architectures, resulting in
   increased technical complexity and reduced interpretability. As a
   result, Generative AI exacerbates a variety of risks common to
   traditional AI systems, including data security vulnerabilities, privacy
   concerns, copyright infringements, and algorithmic biases. This study
   critically assesses the adequacy of current regulatory frameworks in
   addressing these risks. The findings suggest that traditional legal
   instruments are insufficient for managing the unique challenges posed by
   Generative AI, increasing the likelihood of regulatory failure. By
   conducting a comparative analysis of regulatory approaches in the
   European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and China, the
   research reveals a growing global consensus on the necessity of
   developing responsible and trustworthy AI that aligns with Sustainable
   development goals. The paper advocates for the establishment of a
   sustainable and adaptive regulatory framework that aims to enhance
   governmental capacity in addressing the evolving risks associated with
   Generative AI, while simultaneously promoting its safe, accountable, and
   sustainable development.},

Abstract = {The interpretability of gait analysis studies in people with rare

   (pwCA), is frequently limited by the small sample sizes and unbalanced
   datasets. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of
   data balancing and generative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in
   generating synthetic data reflecting the actual gait abnormalities of
   pwCA. Gait data of 30 pwCA (age: 51.6 +/- 12.2 years; 13 females, 17
   males) and 100 healthy subjects (age: 57.1 +/- 10.4; 60 females, 40
   males) were collected at the lumbar level with an inertial measurement
   unit. Subsampling, oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling,
   generative adversarial networks, and conditional tabular generative
   adversarial networks (ctGAN) were applied to generate datasets to be
   input to a random forest classifier. Consistency and explainability
   metrics were also calculated to assess the coherence of the generated
   dataset with known gait abnormalities of pwCA. ctGAN significantly
   improved the classification performance compared with the original
   dataset and traditional data augmentation methods. ctGAN are effective
   methods for balancing tabular datasets from populations with rare

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The evolving field of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI),
   particularly generative deep learning, is revolutionizing a host of
   scientific and technological sectors. One of the pivotal innovations
   within this domain is the emergence of generative adversarial networks
   (GANs). These unique models have shown remarkable capabilities in
   crafting synthetic data, closely emulating real-world distributions.
   Notably, their application to gene expression data systems is a
   fascinating and rapidly growing focus area. Restrictions related to
   ethical and logistical issues often limit the size, diversity, and
   data-gathering speed of gene expression data. Herein lies the potential
   of GANs, as they are capable of producing synthetic gene expression
   data, offering a potential solution to these limitations. This review
   provides a thorough analysis of the most recent advancements at this
   innovative crossroads of GANs and gene expression data, specifically
   during the period from 2019 to 2023. In the context of the fast-paced
   progress in deep learning technologies, accurate and inclusive reviews
   of current practices are critical to guiding subsequent research
   efforts, sharing knowledge, and catalyzing continual growth in the
   discipline. This review, through highlighting recent studies and seminal
   works, serves as a key resource for academics and professionals alike,
   aiding their journey through the compelling confluence of GANs and gene

Abstract = {Spurred by the launch of transformer models like GPT, generative AI
   (Artificial Intelligence) has made enormous strides. This position paper
   identifies two core features that turn generative AI into an exciting
   topic and instrument for psychological research: the scope of use cases
   and the ability to create human-like output. Against this background,
   the paper discusses potential implications for psychological research in
   three areas. First, we observe a burgeoning trend to analyze the
   abilities of generative AI from a psychological perspective. The
   overarching question in this field is whether the output and behavior of
   generative AI exhibit human-like properties. Second, psychological
   research will play an essential role in assessing the impact of
   generative AI on humans. Key questions are about how generative AI can
   be used deceptively, how humans evaluate AI regarding competence or
   warmth, and how generative AI can be leveraged to foster
   knowledge-related processes in interaction with humans. Third, the
   process of psychological research itself is likely to change with
   generative AI. We discuss potential fields of application but also argue
   against some use cases (e. g., employing generative AI as a surrogate
   for participants in experiments). In all three research fields, the
   dualism between the lack of language understanding, coupled with an
   uncanny ability to (re)produce human-like language, is both a challenge
   for and a motivator of psychological research.},

Title = {The moderating role of ethnic culture on adoption intention of
   generative artificial intelligence among university students},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This study is based on an extended model of the Technology Acceptance
   Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology
   (UTAUT) to explore the influencing factors of the adoption intention of
   generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in the higher-education
   environment of multi-ethnic regions. It also focuses on analyzing the
   moderating effects of ethnic culture. Data from 432 university students
   were collected through a questionnaire survey and analyzed using a
   structural equation model. The research findings are as follows: (1) The
   factors influencing university students' adoption intention of
   generative artificial intelligence include perceived ease of use,
   perceived usefulness, social influence, facilitating conditions,
   perceived learning performance, perceived learning efficiency, and user
   satisfaction. (2) Tool designs that are not well-adapted to ethnic
   cultures and the conflicts between practicality and cultural values
   weaken users' perceived usefulness of generative artificial
   intelligence, negatively moderating the impact of perceived usefulness
   on user satisfaction.These findings provide unique insights for
   university administrators in multi-ethnic regions to formulate GAI
   adoption policies. In addition, this study also has certain reference
   significance for other research in the cross-cultural field.},

Title = {The Ethical Boundaries of Chairside Generative Artificial Intelligence
   in Dental Education},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 SEP 19},
Abstract = {In dental school clinics, students are increasingly using Generative
   Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT during patient care.
   This chairside, or point of care, use raises ethical concerns,
   particularly around supervision, patient safety, and training quality.
   This paper argues that GenAI can be ethically used in dental education
   if implemented with transparency, structured oversight, and robust
   ethics training. Using a utilitarian framework, the paper explores how
   GenAI can maximize benefits, such as consistency and efficiency, while
   minimizing harm when used appropriately. It emphasizes that faculty must
   guide students in GenAI use, and that patients should have the
   opportunity to provide informed consent when GenAI influences care.
   Responsibly incorporating GenAI in dental school clinics should prepare
   students to become competent, ethical clinicians in a
   technology-integrated healthcare system.},

   misconduct: insights beyond personal attribute variables},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools has reshaped
   the academic integrity landscape, introducing new challenges to
   maintaining honesty in scholarly work. Unlike traditional plagiarism,
   which typically involves copying existing text, generative artificial
   intelligence-generated content often appears sufficiently original to
   evade detection systems. This underscores the necessity of investigating
   the factors that contribute to such misconduct. This study explores the
   factors associated with Generative AI academic misconduct among
   university students in Taiwan, focusing on personality traits from the
   Dark Tetrad-Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and
   sadism-alongside other personal attribute variables. Data were collected
   from 812 participants (Meanage = 24.86), comprising 439 females and 373
   males, including 362 undergraduates and 450 graduate students. The
   results indicate that narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism significantly
   are significantly associated with Generative AI academic misconduct,
   while gender, educational level, grade point average, and
   Machiavellianism are not significant associated factors. These findings
   highlight the limited relevance of traditional personal attributes as
   associated factors in the context of generative AI and emphasize the
   need for targeted interventions to address personality-driven behaviors
   in mitigating the risks of academic misconduct.},

Journal = {EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe rise of artificial intelligence in the field of medicine
   has had a wide-ranging impact, from clinical applications to research.
   Artificial intelligence-based language models such as Chat Generative
   Pre-Trained Transformer have the potential to expedite the process of
   forensic reporting, particularly in forensic medicine. This study aims
   to evaluate the forensic reporting capabilities of Chat Generative
   Pre-Trained Transformer-4 in comparison with forensic medicine
   assistants. The Turkish Penal Code-related forensic medicine guide and
   20 case examples were used to train Chat Generative Pre-Trained
   Transformer-4 in this study. Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer-4
   was asked to write reports like forensic medicine specialists. In the
   retrospective phase, 100 forensic cases were assessed by Chat Generative
   Pre-Trained Transformer-4, while in the prospective phase, 266 new cases
   were assessed by both Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer-4 and
   forensic medicine assistants. Two forensic medicine specialists assessed
   the accuracy of these reports in terms of adherence to the forensic
   medicine guide.ResultsChat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer-4 achieved
   an accuracy rate of 96.6\% in the retrospective phase and 96.2\% in the
   prospective phase for the combined categories of ``Life-threatening{''}
   and ``Simple Medical Intervention{''}. Forensic medicine assistants,
   however, demonstrated a higher accuracy rate of 99.1\% in these
   categories compared to Chat Generative Pre-Trained
   Transformer-4.ConclusionsThe success of Chat Generative Pre-Trained
   Transformer-4 indicates that the combination of technology and human
   expertise could establish new standards in forensic reporting. However,
   it is emphasized that supervision by forensic medicine specialists
   remains crucial in this process.},

   the evaluation of AI that is dedicated to education (AIED), and do not
   consider AI devices designed for broader applications. Above all, the
   systematic review identifies more than forty indicators used in the
   assessments of the impact of AI on learning; indicators that can be
   grouped into six key dimensions: technological, learning achievement,
   pedagogical, interaction, affective, metacognitive. This provides a

   instructors in higher education. In this article, I propose a
   collaborative course design strategy to create a syllabus genAI use
   policy that is better equipped to handle the nuances of genAI use in
   higher education while also serving to democratize the classroom space
   in alignment with collaborative learning and teaching principles. I
   analyze the results of engaging this process over three consecutive
   semesters of sociology classes, including the created policies and my
   experiences enforcing them. Lastly, I reflect on how the activity
   changed as it was iterated on and how it might be adapted to alternate

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is becoming increasingly
   present in scientific research, in the form of chatbots like ChatGPT,
   which facilitate discovery, analysis and writing. The first part of the
   article reviews the complex architecture of artificial intelligence, and
   the socio-ethical benefits and risks associated with its use in
   academia. A selection of virtual assistants classified by function is
   proposed, along with an evaluation grid for these tools. Generative
   technology acts as a catalyst for profound changes in information
   culture, calling into question methods of information retrieval and
   intellectual property over algorithmic content. The second part focuses
   on AI literacy and its intersection with information literacy,
   highlighting gaps in the literature and the need for further study.
   Artificial intelligence being a cumulative, highly specialized and
   highly controversial phenomenon, university libraries are not yet
   equipped to implement this technology wisely, hence the importance of
   setting up a new competency framework and a training program adapted to
   the information and documentation professions.},

Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is attracting the increasing
   attention of materials community for its excellent capability of
   generating required contents. With the introduction of Prompt paradigm
   and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), GAI shifts from
   the task-specific to general pattern gradually, enabling to tackle
   multiple complicated tasks involved in resolving the structure-activity
   re-lationships. Here, we review the development status of GAI
   comprehensively and analyze pros and cons of various generative models
   in the view of methodology. The applications of task-specific generative
   models involving materials inverse design and data augmentation are also
   dissected. Taking ChatGPT as an example, we explore the potential
   applications of general GAI in generating multiple materials content,
   solving differential equation as well as querying materials FAQs.
   Furthermore, we summarize six challenges encountered for the use of GAI
   in materials science and provide the corresponding solutions. This work
   paves the way for providing effective and explainable materials data

Abstract = {The recent success of large language models (LLMs) in performing natural
   language processing tasks has increased interest in applying generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) to scientific research. However, a common
   problem of LLMs is their tendency to produce inaccurate and sometimes
   ``hallucinated{''} outputs. Here, we established a generative AI tool,
   NanoSafari, to automatically extract knowledge from the biomedical
   nanoscience literature and address scientific queries. We developed the
   Grouped Iterative Validation based Information Extraction (GIVE) method
   to extract contextual information on nanoparticle characteristics from
   >20,000 published articles and established a database that was
   incorporated into the generative LLM to provide accurate nanomaterial
   design parameters. Blinded evaluation by biomedical nanoscientists
   showed that NanoSafari outperformed the baseline model in providing more
   reliable parameters for nanomaterial design tasks, as further validated
   by bench experiments. Together, these findings demonstrate the utility
   of AI-based methods for automated learning from ``real-world{''}

   for making sense of modern technologies that increasingly seem to step
   in the realm that has been reserved for humans - creativity. This paper
   aims to understand the role of the human in generative art by
   demystifying implications of black-box generative algorithms and their
   applications for artistic purposes. First, we present examples of
   current practice and research in generative art with a special interest
   in music that served as foundation for our work. Then, we introduce
   Anastatica (2020), a part performance, part installation built on the
   basis of data-driven generative live coding. Finally, we discuss the
   various implications of AI in art through a case study rooted in
   Anastatica's development and performance. Here we trace the path from
   algorithms to intelligence, applying both musical and computer science
   theory to a practical case of generating a live coding musical

Abstract = {This study investigates how Generative Artificial Intelligence Supported
   Entrepreneurship Education (GAISEE) influences university students'
   entrepreneurial intentions through a quantitative analysis of Chinese
   higher education institutions. Using structural equation modeling with
   data from 346 university students, we demonstrate that GAISEE
   significantly enhances both entrepreneurial self-efficacy (beta = 0.523,
   p < 0.001) and entrepreneurial intention (beta = 0.244, p < 0.001). The
   research reveals that entrepreneurial self-efficacy mediates the
   relationship between GAISEE and entrepreneurial intention, while the
   university entrepreneurial environment moderates these relationships.
   Notably, an optimized university environment strengthens the positive
   effects of GAISEE on both entrepreneurial self-efficacy (beta = 0.333, p
   < 0.001) and entrepreneurial intention (beta = 0.207, p < 0.001). These

   Entrepreneurship: Insights from the Entrepreneurial Event Model},
Journal = {ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH JOURNAL},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 SEP 16},
Abstract = {The increasing integration of artificial intelligence into
   entrepreneurial activities has transformed how individuals engage with
   digital innovation. This study examines the correlation between the
   congruence and incongruence of innovative and routine use of generative
   artificial intelligence (ambidexterity) and digital entrepreneurial
   intention. Drawing on the entrepreneurial event model, polynomial
   regression, and response surface analysis, the study examines the
   congruence and incongruence between routine and innovative uses of
   generative artificial intelligence, capturing their complex interactions
   and joint effects. Data collected from 1,061 undergraduate students at
   Vietnamese universities revealed significant congruence effects, showing
   that alignment between high levels of routine and innovative uses
   enhances students' digital entrepreneurial intention, perceived
   desirability, and feasibility. Furthermore, the incongruence between
   these uses has a negative relationship with entrepreneurial outcomes.
   The study also confirms that perceived desirability and feasibility
   mediate the relationships between generative artificial intelligence use
   (routine and innovative) and digital entrepreneurial intention. These
   findings extend current understandings of how digital tools support
   entrepreneurship education, highlighting the importance of balancing
   exploitation (routine use) and exploration (innovative use).
   Practically, the results suggest that educators and policymakers should
   encourage students to simultaneously develop both routine and innovative
   competencies in generative artificial intelligence to nurture digital
   entrepreneurial aspirations effectively.},

Title = {Does Artificial Intelligence Cause Artificial Confidence? Generative
   Artificial Intelligence as an Emerging Social Referent},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 28},
Abstract = {As generative artificial intelligence (gen-AI) becomes more prevalent,
   it becomes increasingly important to understand how people
   psychologically respond to the content it explicitly creates. In this
   research, we demonstrate that exposure to gen-AI produced content can
   affect people's self-confidence at the same task through a social
   comparison process. Anchoring this research in the domain of creativity,
   we find that exposing people to creative content believed to have been
   created by gen-AI (vs. a human peer) increases people's self-confidence
   in their own relevant creative abilities. This effect emerges for jokes,
   stories, poetry, and visual art, and it can consequently increase
   people's willingness to attempt the activity-even though the greater
   confidence underscoring their actions might be unwarranted. We further
   show that these effects emerge because gen-AI is perceived as a lower
   social referent for creative endeavors, bolstering people's own
   self-perceptions. As a result, for domains in which gen-AI is perceived
   as an equal or greater social referent (i.e., in fact-based domains),
   the effects are attenuated. These findings have significant implications
   for understanding human-AI interactions, antecedents for creative
   self-confidence, and the known referents that people use for social
   comparison effects.},

Abstract = {We are witnessing an accelerated technological evolution that has
   enabled the development of artificial intelligence in various fields,

   cover only a small subset of AI technologies in our paper, that of
   Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Our objectives are to shed
   light on the legal issues that GenAI can cause and to find solutions to
   them. We begin with a definition of GenAI in the much broader context of
   AI technologies. Answers to a few essential questions are to be found:
   `How does GenAI work?', `What could GenAI be used for?', `What legal
   issues could arise from using a GenAI?'. To accomplish our goals, we
   first conduct a literature review to define artificial intelligence (AI)
   in general and GenAI in particular. Several lawsuits are chosen to
   illustrate the magnitude of the legal problems and to test the
   feasibility of possible solutions in both the national and EU legal
   systems. Then, we analyse GenAI's output, liability for its contents and
   for its use, altogether with examples of related contractual clauses.},

Abstract = {Student gender differences in technology acceptance and use have
   persisted for years, giving rise to equity concerns in higher education
   (HE). To explore if such differences extend to generative artificial

   student sample (n = 2692) using a fully mixed concurrent equal status
   design. Our findings show that men exhibit more frequent engagement with
   genAI chatbots across a broader spectrum of applications. Further, men
   demonstrate a heightened interest in genAI chatbots as tools and in
   their relevance to future career prospects. Women primarily utilize
   genAI chatbots in text-related tasks and express greater concerns
   regarding critical and independent thinking. Women also exhibit a
   stronger need to learn how to determine when it is wise to use and how
   to trust genAI chatbots. Consequences are discussed for the individual,

   collected the responses to these questions from three types of
   generative AI. The responses were evaluated on a 5-point scale by six
   pediatric dental specialists using the Global Quality Scale. Results:
   The average scores were >3 for the three types of generated AI tools
   that we tested; the overall average was 3.34. Although the responses for
   questions related to ``consultations from guardians{''} or ``systemic
   diseases{''} had high scores (>3.5), the score for questions related to
   ``dental abnormalities{''} was 2.99, which was the lowest among the four

Abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into academic

   enhancement. We explore the current state of transparency regarding
   generative AI use in nursing academic research journals, emphasizing the
   need for explicitly declaring the use of generative AI by authors in the
   manuscript. Out of 125 nursing studies journals, 37.6\% required
   explicit statements about generative AI use in their authors'
   guidelines. No significant differences in impact factors or journal
   categories were found between journals with and without such
   requirement. A similar evaluation of medicine, general and internal

   about generative AI usage. Declaring generative AI tool usage is crucial
   for maintaining the transparency and credibility in academic writing.
   Additionally, extending the requirement for AI usage declarations to
   journal reviewers can enhance the quality of peer review and combat
   predatory journals in the academic publishing landscape. Our study

Abstract = {This research examines the transformative potential of artificial
   intelligence (AI) in general and Generative AI (GAI) in particular in
   supply chain and operations management (SCOM). Through the lens of the
   resource-based view and based on key AI capabilities such as learning,
   perception, prediction, interaction, adaptation, and reasoning, we
   explore how AI and GAI can impact 13 distinct SCOM decision-making
   areas. These areas include but are not limited to demand forecasting,
   inventory management, supply chain design, and risk management. With its
   outcomes, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of AI and
   GAI's functionality and applications in the SCOM context, offering a
   practical framework for both practitioners and researchers. The proposed
   framework systematically identifies where and how AI and GAI can be
   applied in SCOM, focussing on decision-making enhancement, process
   optimisation, investment prioritisation, and skills development.
   Managers can use it as a guidance to evaluate their operational
   processes and identify areas where AI and GAI can deliver improved
   efficiency, accuracy, resilience, and overall effectiveness. The
   research underscores that AI and GAI, with their multifaceted
   capabilities and applications, open a revolutionary potential and
   substantial implications for future SCOM practices, innovations, and
   research.},

Abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represents a
   watershed moment in the evolution of digital platforms. The capabilities
   of this AI technology go beyond traditional AI systems, enabling the
   autonomous generation of novel outcomes with significant implications
   for platform value creation, architecture, governance, and stakeholder
   interactions. We develop an integrative conceptual framework that
   identifies four key mechanisms through which GenAI transforms digital
   platforms: intelligent automation, democratization,
   hyper-personalization, and collaborative innovation. Through intelligent
   automation, GenAI transforms boundary resources from passive interfaces
   into active, intelligent mediators of value creation. Democratization
   systematically lowers barriers to platform participation.
   Hyper-personalization enables dynamic, individual-level adaptation of
   platform content. Collaborative innovation transforms platform
   innovation by making GenAI an active participant in human-AI value
   co-creation. We use this framework to situate the papers in the special
   issue and develop a research agenda that explores the transformative
   impact of GenAI on platform stakeholder relationships.},

   investigate how GenAI changes our school education from the perspectives
   of teachers and leaders. It used four domains - learning, teaching,
   assessment, and administration - as the initial framework suggested in a
   systematic literature review study on AI in education. The participants
   were 88 school teachers and leaders of different backgrounds. They
   completed a survey and joined a focus group to share how ChatGPT and
   Midjounery had a GenAI effect on school education. Thematic analysis
   identified four main themes and 12 subthemes. The findings provide three
   suggestions for practices: know-it-all attitude, new prerequisite
   knowledge, interdisciplinary teaching, and three implications for
   policy: new assessment, AI education, and professional standards. They
   also further suggest six future research directions for GenAI in

   thematic analysis},
Journal = {SCIENCE EDITING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-34},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Purpose: This analysis aims to propose guidelines for artificial
   intelligence (AI) research ethics in scientific publications, intending
   to inform publishers and academic institutional policies in order to
   guide them toward a coherent and consistent approach to AI research
   ethics. Methods: A literature-based thematic analysis was conducted. The
   study reviewed the publication policies of the top 10 journal publishers
   addressing the use of AI in scholarly publications as of October 2024.
   Thematic analysis using ATLAS.ti identified themes and subthemes across
   the documents, which were consolidated into proposed research ethics
   guidelines for using generative AI and AI-assisted tools in scholarly
   publications. Results: The analysis revealed inconsistencies among
   publishers' policies on AI use in research and publications. AI-assisted
   tools for grammar and formatting are generally accepted, but positions
   vary regarding generative AI tools used in pre-writing and research
   methods. Key themes identified include author accountability, human
   oversight, recognized and unrecognized uses of AI tools, and the
   necessity for transparency in disclosing AI usage. All publishers agree
   that AI tools cannot be listed as authors. Concerns involve biases,
   quality and reliability issues, compliance with intellectual property
   rights, and limitations of AI detection tools. Conclusion: The article
   highlights the significant knowledge gap and inconsistencies in
   guidelines for AI use in scientific research. There is an urgent need
   for unified ethical standards, and guidelines are proposed for
   distinguishing between the accepted use of AI-assisted tools and the
   cautious use of generative AI tools.},

   Moreover, confirmatory factor analysis was performed using Amos (Version
   28.0) to assess the validity of the measurement models. The results
   indicate that proactive personality exerts an indirect effect on
   career-related decision-making self-efficacy via generative artificial

Abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality worldwide,
   especially in resource-limited countries with limited access to
   healthcare resources. Early detection and accurate imaging are vital for
   managing CVD, emphasizing the significance of patient education.
   Generative artificial intelligence (AI), including algorithms to
   synthesize text, speech, images, and combinations thereof given a
   specific scenario or prompt, offers promising solutions for enhancing
   patient education. By combining vision and language models, generative
   AI enables personalized multimedia content generation through natural

   learning, support critical thinking, and prepare students for
   professional use of GAI. We examine the role of GAI tools in
   facilitating learning and reflect on the implications for teachers and
   higher education institutions. Our findings demonstrate that GAI tools
   can mediate learning by bridging subject knowledge gaps, enabling
   adaptive and scalable support, and fostering GAI literacy through
   hands-on engagement while underscoring the continued importance of human
   educators in providing critical, ethical, and contextual guidance.},

Abstract = {The economic logic of the attention economy is frequently used to
   critique and respond to the dangers of unfettered technological
   expansion, including nascent platforms and products powered by
   generative artificial intelligence. This commentary warns that while
   large parts of the internet have been financed through such business
   models, there is no guarantee that emerging generative artificial
   intelligence products will be commercialized in this way too. Instead, I
   argue, we must look beyond the attention economy to predict the future
   of monetization of an industry already mired in anti-competitive
   practices. Using popular large language models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT
   as a case, I discuss how some platforms are developing computational
   dependencies between technology and their users. I propose the term
   `cognitive lock-in' to help us unpack the implications of such
   technological dependencies, and redirect the study of this nascent
   business model.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS},

Abstract = {Traditional decision-making frameworks are insufficient for managing the
   increasingly challenging complexities, uncertainties, and sustainability
   requirements within global supply chains. Existing decision-making
   models typically rely on static optimisation or fragmented heuristics,
   lacking the capacity to adapt to dynamic trade-offs in environmental,
   operational, and economic dimensions. To address this gap, this study
   developed UNISONE, a generative artificial intelligence-driven
   decision-making model integrating multi-criteria reasoning, adaptive
   learning, and scenario-based simulation to support sustainable supply
   chain management and smart logistics within the paradigm of Industry
   5.0. An empirical case study conducted on Tepla Technology Corporation,
   demonstrated that this framework improved delivery responsiveness,
   carbon efficiency, and sourcing stability. Numerical analysis confirmed
   that GAI, when aligned with structured goal hierarchies and
   feedback-driven evaluation, enhanced organisational agility and
   long-term sustainability orientation. This research extends theoretical
   knowledge on artificial-intelligence-driven supply chain models and
   provides a practical roadmap for implementing intelligent logistics

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 led to major controversies about the
   governance of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This article
   examines the first international governance and policy initiatives
   dedicated specifically to generative AI: the G7 Hiroshima process, the
   Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reports, and the
   UK AI Safety Summit. This analysis is informed by policy framing and
   governance literature, in particular by the work on technology
   governance and Responsible Innovation. Emerging governance of generative
   AI exhibits characteristics of polycentric governance, where multiple
   and overlapping centers of decision-making are in collaborative
   relationships. However, it is dominated by a limited number of developed
   countries. The governance of generative AI is mostly framed in terms of
   the risk management, largely neglecting issues of purpose and direction
   of innovation, and assigning rather limited roles to the public. We can
   see a ``paradox of generative AI governance{''} emerging, namely, that
   while this technology is being widely used by the public, its governance
   is rather narrow. This article coins the term ``governance fix{''} to
   capture this rather narrow and technocratic approach to governing
   generative AI. As an alternative, it suggests embracing the politics of
   polycentric governance and Responsible Innovation that highlight
   democratic and participatory co-shaping of technology for social
   benefit. In the context of the highly unequal distribution of power in
   generative AI characterized by a high concentration of power in a small
   number of large tech companies, the government has a special role in
   reshaping the power imbalances by enabling wide-ranging public
   participation in the governance of generative AI.},

   This review compares generative artificial intelligence with five

   From a historical perspective, each technological breakthrough has
   affected education by changing how symbols are represented and how

   The emergence of new educational technology is always accompanied by
   doubt, vigilance, and rejection from the traditional community.
   The new educational technology, generative artificial intelligence,
   interacts with the old, creating an increasingly complex ecology of
   educational technology.
   Three suggestions are proposed for adjusting the education system:
   first, promoting small-scale, individualized, and conversational
   teaching in schools; second, developing teachers' and students' digital
   literacy in a multi-curricula system; and third, conducting research on

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {1787-1798},
Abstract = {Commercial utilization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is
   expanding rapidly. However, few studies have investigated the
   transformative impact of GAI on business operations, with a specific
   focus on research and development (R\&D) and advertising facilitated by
   AI-generated content (AIGC) empowerment; particularly, there is a lack
   of analysis on the impact of AIGC iteration on firms' decision-making.
   The study uses the optimal control and learning-by-doing method to
   examine two types of AIGC strategies, the single AIGC (enhancing R\&D
   exclusively) and the dual AIGC (simultaneously boosting R\&D and
   advertising), to delve into their dynamic iteration effects on firms'
   performance. Our findings reveal that, under the single AIGC strategy,
   focusing on investments in the AI training R\&D sector alone can enhance
   the GAI smartness level more effectively than adopting the dual AIGC
   strategy. Conversely, under the dual AIGC strategy, firms initially tend
   to select GAI empowerment toward the downstream advertising sector more
   than the upstream R\&D sector. Both strategies demonstrate enhanced
   profits and increased demand with higher rates of AIGC self-learning.
   Notably, considering the limited budget, firms prioritize allocating AI
   training resources to the R\&D sector under the dual AIGC strategy,
   guaranteeing their long-term success.},

Abstract = {The use of Generative Artificial Intelligence has raised concerns

   IberoAmerica. Methodology: : A survey was conducted among 154
   participants through a cycle of webinars held at four universities in
   Ibero-America during the second semester of 2023, corresponding to 14
   countries in the region, including academics, researchers and students
   of Journalism (and related degrees in Social Communication), along with
   managers and journalists from prominent media outlets. Results: :
   although journalistic experiences with AI are still incipient in the
   region, the responses obtained show that most participants use
   generative AI tools every week, there is greater knowledge (and
   preference) for ChatGPT, , and there is a consensus regarding how
   artificial intelligence can bring great benefits if it has the proper
   regulations.},

Title = {Perceptions of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), Behavioral

   Learning Agency in Generative AI-Supported Contexts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Student learning agency, encompassing key abilities, essential mental
   characteristics and active actions, is recognized as a crucial factor
   for effective teaching and learning in the generative artificial
   intelligence (AI) era. This study examines the structural relationships
   among perceptions of generative AI (i.e., effort expectancy, performance
   expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions), behavioral
   intention, use experience, and student learning agency by integrating
   sociocultural perceptions, intentionality, and life course perspectives.
   Data were collected from 765 Chinese university students and analyzed
   using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling.
   Results showed that key abilities and essential mental characteristics
   predicted active actions, while key abilities predicted essential mental
   characteristics; behavioral intention predicted active actions and is
   predicted by key abilities; performance expectancy and social influence
   predicted behavioral intention; performance expectancy predicted
   essential mental characteristics; facilitating conditions predicted key
   abilities but negatively predicted active actions; the frequency of
   generative AI use predicted key abilities but negatively predicted
   essential mental characteristics; the number of scenarios of generative
   AI use predicted active actions and key abilities; use experience with
   generative AI negatively moderated the social influence-behavioral
   intention relationship. These findings provided valuable implications
   for designing educational strategies to enhance student learning agency
   in generative AI-supported environments.},

Abstract = {The professional development curriculum is a vital component in
   physician training and is important for helping trainees develop as
   competent and reflective practitioners. The advent of generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) will likely have a significant impact on
   the assessment of the professional qualities curriculum in physician
   training. The development of professional qualities as well as
   self-reflection is currently assessed through personal reflection
   essays. These reflection essays are particularly vulnerable to new
   developments in generative AI, which are capable of producing
   high-quality outputs that can pass as trainee-created responses.
   Generative AI-produced reflection essays are becoming increasingly
   difficult to detect using AI-detection software. The challenge remains
   how best to incorporate AI into learning while safeguarding the
   attainment and assessment of learning goals within the multiple domains
   of professional development. This article discusses several options for
   safeguarding the professional qualities curriculum in medical education
   and vocational training. Discussion-based activities may very well prove
   to be a suitable potential replacement for the current professional
   reflection essay.},

Title = {Rethinking evidence-informed policy and practice in the age of
   generative artificial intelligence},
Journal = {LONDON REVIEW OF EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The rise of generative artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT is
   transforming how knowledge is produced, accessed and used across
   educational systems. While these technologies offer new opportunities
   for efficiency and scalability, they also challenge foundational
   assumptions about what counts as evidence, how it is interpreted and who
   holds epistemic authority. The article argues that models of
   evidence-informed policy and practice (EIPP), although still valuable,
   require recalibration to address the emerging demands of educational
   contexts mediated by artificial intelligence. Drawing on recent research
   in artificial intelligence, critical thinking and professional practice,
   the article proposes a reframing model-EIPP-CT (Evidence-Informed Policy
   and Practice with Critical Thinking)-that places critical thinking at
   the heart of evidence use. Here, critical thinking is conceptualised not
   merely as a cognitive skill, but as a professional stance encompassing
   interpretive judgement, epistemic reflexivity and ethical
   responsibility. The article outlines key risks of over-reliance on
   content generated by artificial intelligence, including automation bias
   and diminished transparency, and advocates for institutional safeguards
   and professional development that foster context-sensitive, deliberative
   engagement with evidence. It concludes by calling for more systematic
   research and policy attention to the shifting epistemic landscape of
   education. In doing so, it aims to preserve the integrity of
   evidence-informed decision-making in a world increasingly shaped by
   algorithmic technologies.},

   algorithm},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {190-208},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {This study introduces a novel 3D preform design method that leverages
   generative artificial intelligence to optimise complex forging
   geometries. The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a
   two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged
   shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (beta-VAE) serves as the
   generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural
   networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently.
   The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using
   isosurfaces derived from Laplace's equation. A multi-objective
   optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash
   volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed
   using this method and validated through forging experiments on two
   target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV)
   manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared
   with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed
   method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill
   and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced
   computational techniques with practical validation, offering a
   systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D
   preform design in forging processes.},

   researchers to address scientific and engineering challenges. This paper
   aims to fill a gap in the research community by providing a
   comprehensive review of how DGMs have been utilized in energy system
   applications. Based on five of the most popular DGMs, we review and
   categorize 228 research articles into five focus areas: data generation,
   forecasting, situational awareness, modeling, and optimal
   decision-making. Through this classification, we uncover trends in how
   DGMs are employed for each type of problem, highlighting GAI techniques
   that contribute to breakthroughs over traditional methods. We discuss
   limitations in existing literature, engineering challenges, and propose
   future directions, all tailored to the unique nature of problems in

Abstract = {This study investigates the collaborative supervision strategies of
   Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in the hospitality and tourism
   industry, focusing on managing risks in GAI-based travel
   recommendations. Using evolutionary game theory and system dynamics, a
   tripartite model is developed, involving the government, GAI companies,

   are identified, showing how stakeholder behaviour evolves under
   different scenarios. The model operates through `dual supervision, one
   implementation', with government regulation, tourist monitoring, and GAI
   self-regulation via AI or manual reviews. Simulations indicate that
   combined government and tourist involvement enhances self-regulation,
   with subsidies being more effective than penalties. While GAI companies
   may currently favour manual reviews, the potential for AI-driven reviews
   remains substantial. This framework provides practical insights for

Abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, particularly the
   rise of deep learning, the importance of Explainable Artificial
   Intelligence has become increasingly prominent. Among its key
   techniques, counterfactual explanation plays a crucial role in
   understanding the decision-making mechanisms of opaque models. However,
   the high dimensionality and complex feature patterns of image data pose
   significant challenges for the task of generating counterfactuals for
   images. Existing literature has proposed various algorithms based on
   different assumptions, many of which rely on the existence of
   appropriate generative models. Some of these assumptions, particularly
   the assumption regarding the existence of generative models, may be
   overly stringent. To address this issue, this letter introduces a novel
   assumption-free image counterfactual generation algorithm, DFO-S, based
   on Score Matching and gradient-free optimization techniques. The
   proposed method achieves high-quality counterfactual generation without
   relying on generative models. Through extensive empirical analysis, we
   demonstrate the significant superiority of our method in terms of
   performance.},

Abstract = {Regarding tools and systems from artificial intelligence (AI),
   chat-based ones from the area of generative AI have become a major focus
   regarding media coverage. ChatGPT and occasionally other systems (such
   as those from Microsoft and Google) are discussed with hundreds if not
   thousands of academic papers as well as newspaper articles. While
   various areas have considerably gone into this discussion,
   transportation and logistics has not yet come that far. In this paper,
   we explore the use of generative AI tools within this domain. More
   specifically, we focus on a topic related to sustainable passenger
   transportation, that is, the handling of disturbances in public
   transport when it comes to bus bunching and bus bridging. The first of
   these concepts is related to analyzing situations where we observe two
   or more buses of the same line following close to each other without
   being planned deliberately and the second is related to the case where
   buses are used to replace broken connections in other systems, such as
   subways. Generative AI tools seem to be able to provide meaningful
   entries and a lot of food for thought while the academic use may still
   be classified as limited.},

Abstract = {This article examines sociotechnical imaginaries of generative
   artificial intelligence (GenAI) through the cultural lens of the film
   Barbie. The hyperreal setting of Barbieland serves as a prescient
   metaphor for education in an increasingly synthetic world where the real
   and artificial converge. By analysing representations of artificiality
   and authenticity in the film, I argue that similar cultural assumptions
   and anxieties shape how GenAI is understood and implemented in
   education. The Barbie doll's transformation from plastic figure to
   `real' human raises questions about embodiment and identity that
   parallel debates about human-machine relationships in learning
   environments. Drawing on concepts of simulacra and agential realism, I
   explore how narratives of technological empowerment influence
   educational practice. By juxtaposing Western-centric views of Barbie
   with Indigenous perspectives, particularly Ellen van Neerven's `Water',
   the article critiques dominant cultural narratives about technology and
   intelligence. This comparison challenges commercial imaginaries of
   technological empowerment and suggests more diverse, culturally
   responsive approaches are needed to integrate GenAI in education.},

   Generative AI into mathematics in management education by combining
   human oversight and instructor control through three innovative
   features: (1) a Generative AI-based simulation, (2) a macropowered Excel
   worksheet for validating the calculations of an AI chatbot, and (3) a
   Google Sheets dashboard for centralizing team-generated AI data for
   postgame analysis. Our study included 41 students divided into
   experimental and control groups. Pretest results indicated no

Abstract = {Continued efforts to incorporate the use of artificial intelligence
   within post-secondary education efforts requires its incorporation by
   teachers in their day-to-day educational practices. Generative
   artificial intelligence, through platforms like ChatGPT, introduce
   opportunities and cautions to its' use with teaching-learning, but it is
   equally important to consider a more comprehensive picture of artificial
   intelligence's (AI) use within education. The merits of using AI in
   teaching practices to support student learning may be undervalued by
   teachers and therefore under utilised. A paucity of available tools to
   explore teachers' intentions to use AI is a pressing issue. The creation
   and testing for reliability and validity of one tool, the Artificial
   Intelligence Acceptance Measurement Survey (AIAMS) is discussed in this
   article. It is believed that the AIAMS will serve to support further
   research and understanding of what influences teachers and their
   intentions to use AI within their teaching efforts. The important role
   teachers realise with student learning suggests that research focused on
   this area is imperative as we move forward in working with AI in
   education.},

Abstract = {Recently, artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has been
   receiving increased attention and is growing exponentially. AIGC is
   generated based on the intentional information extracted from
   human-provided instructions by generative artificial intelligence (AI)
   models. AIGC quickly and automatically generates large amounts of
   high-quality content. Currently, there is a shortage of medical
   resources and complex medical procedures in medicine. Due to its
   characteristics, AIGC can help alleviate these problems. As a result,
   the application of AIGC in medicine has gained increased attention in
   recent years. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review on
   the recent state of studies involving AIGC in medicine. First, we
   present an overview of AIGC. Furthermore, based on recent studies, the
   application of AIGC in medicine is reviewed from two aspects: medical
   image processing and medical text generation. The basic generative AI
   models, tasks, target organs, datasets and contribution of studies are
   considered and summarized. Finally, we also discuss the limitations and
   challenges faced by AIGC and propose possible solutions with relevant
   studies. We hope this review can help readers understand the potential
   of AIGC in medicine and obtain some innovative ideas in this field.},

Abstract = {The evolution of consumer electronics is increasingly driven by
   advancements in industrial automation, where generative artificial
   intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role, particularly in intent-based
   systems. This study presents a comprehensive framework for integrating
   generative AI into intent-based industrial automation, which aims to
   align high-level business goals with precise operational tasks on the
   factory floor. The proposed architecture synergistically combines three
   main components: Business Intents, the Intent Layer, and the Factory
   Floor Shop. This framework leverages foundation models such as the most
   prominent large language models (LLMs) and advanced communication
   technologies to translate strategic business intents-such as cost
   optimization, order management, and market adaptation into actionable
   tasks to improve operational efficiency, responsiveness, and strategic
   alignment. We also propose a process of fine-tuning LLMs to optimize
   their interaction flow within the intent-based system, highlighting the
   augmentation techniques employed to adapt LLMs for industrial contexts.
   Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   framework and show percentage improvements compared to pretrained LLM
   models.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive examination of the ongoing debate
   surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its societal implications,
   with a particular focus on job displacement. The release of generative
   AI tools for public use, particularly ChatGPT, has created numerous
   concerns on how these tools will be used and adverse impacts on society.
   Augmented Intelligence has been introduced as a concept utilizing AI to
   enhance human capabilities but its distinction as an assistive role is
   ill-defined. This research provides insights into the
   reconceptualization of AI as Augmented Intelligence examining their
   differences in terms of knowledge development, decision-making, and
   outcomes. Through three case studies, we demonstrate the assistive role
   of Augmented Intelligence and how it can serve as a catalyst for job
   creation and cognitive enhancement. We also explore the impact of AI and
   IA tools as a sociotechnical system and their effect on human cognitive
   abilities through the theoretical lens of the Dunning Kruger Effect. We
   conclude with a research agenda to stimulate future directions of
   research.},

Journal = {OPEN PRAXIS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the pivotal axis around
   which transformation revolves is human-AI interaction. In this sense,
   this paper adopts a data mining and analytic approach to understand what
   the related literature tells us regarding the trends and patterns of
   generative AI research in educational praxis. Accordingly, this
   systematic exploration spotlights the following research themes:
   Interaction and communication with generative AI-powered chatbots;
   impact of the LLMs and generative AI on teaching and learning,
   conversational educational agents and their opportunities, challenges,
   and implications; leveraging Generative AI for enhancing social and
   cognitive learning processes; promoting AI literacy for unleashing
   future opportunities; harnessing Generative AI to expand academic
   capabilities, and lastly, augmenting educational experiences through
   human-AI interaction. Beyond the identified research themes and
   patterns, this paper argues that emotional intelligence, AI literacy,
   and prompt engineering are the trending research topics that require
   further exploration. Accordingly, it's in this praxis that emotional
   intelligence emerges as a pivotal attribute, as AI technologies often
   struggle to comprehend and respond to the nuanced emotional cues.
   Generative AI literacy then takes center stage, becoming an
   indispensable asset in an era permeated with AI technologies, equipping
   students with the tools to critically engage with AI systems, thereby
   ensuring they become active, discerning users of these powerful tools.
   Concurrently, prompt engineering, the art of crafting queries that yield
   precise and valuable responses from AI systems, empowers both educators
   and students to maximize the utility of AI-driven educational resources.},

   A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {87742-87766},
Abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs), which generate personalized content, have
   become a technological tool with diverse applications for users. While
   numerous RSs have been proposed and successfully implemented across
   various domains, traditional AI-based RSs still encounter certain
   challenges, such as data sparsity, cold start, and diversity. Generative
   Artificial Intelligence in recommender systems is a recent advancement
   used by platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon to recommend items,
   news, videos, audios, goods, and services to their customers/users or to
   personalize experiences for their customers/users. The main purpose of
   this review is to compare traditional AI-based recommender systems with
   generative AI-based recommender systems. A total of fifty-two (52)
   papers, published between 2019 and February 2024, were selected from six
   major online libraries. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the
   selected study, we reviewed the selected studies techniques, and the
   models, datasets, and metrics used. Our systematic review reveals that
   generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),
   variational autoencoder (VAEs) and autoencoders have been widely used in
   recommender systems and they perform better than traditional AI
   techniques. Among the 30 datasets analyzed, MovieLens was the most
   frequently used, accounting for 33\%, while Amazon datasets accounted
   for 11\%, Recall and RSME are the most commonly used metrics. Our
   literature review offers understandings into the Generative AI
   techniques used across different recommender systems and provides
   suggestions for the future research. Finally, we elaborated on open
   issues and discussed current and future trends in generative AI-based
   recommendation systems.},

   existing research focuses on general nursing scenarios. And is still in
   the exploratory stage in the specialty field and lacks a systematic
   compendium of its application in the field of cardiovascular specialty
   nursing.ObjectiveA review of studies related to the application of
   generative artificial intelligence in the field of specialized
   cardiovascular nursing informing relevant research and
   practice.MethodsThis review was conducted according to the JBI
   guidelines for scoping reviews, using the PRISMA-ScR reporting tool.The
   databases searched included PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, APA
   PsycNetInfo (Ovid), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL,
   SinoMed, CNKI, WanFang databases, peer-reviewed studies written in
   English and Chinese from the time of database construction until March
   29, 2025. Eligible studies were screened by title and abstract, and
   full-text screening was performed by two independent
   evaluators.ResultsNineteen studies were included in this review, and the
   main application tools were 9 text generation models, 3 multimodal
   generation models, 4 temporal prediction models, and 3 chatbots. The
   application scenarios mainly include clinical decision support, patient
   health management, and nursing education and counseling. Generative
   artificial intelligence has outstanding effects in reducing nursing
   workload and precise intervention, but there are limitations in the
   field of health education and counseling, such as logical disconnection,
   poor information quality, and lack of humanistic
   care.ConclusionsGenerative artificial intelligence provides technical
   support for the intelligent transformation of cardiovascular specialty
   care, especially effective in the areas of clinical decision support and
   patient health management. There is an urgent need to solve the existing
   problems to promote its in-depth application in this field, and it is
   suggested that future research focuses on the construction of

Abstract = {Text generation tools, often presented as a form of generative
   artificial intelligence, have the potential to pose a threat to the
   integrity of the educational system. They can be misused to afford
   students marks and qualifications that they do not deserve. The
   emergence of recent tools, such as ChatGPT, appear to have left the
   educational community unprepared, despite the fact that the computer
   science community has been working to develop and improve such tools for
   years. This paper provides an introduction to text generation tools
   intended for a non-specialist audience, discussing the types of
   assessments that students can outsource, showing the type of prompts
   that can be used to generate text, and illustrating one possible
   watermarking technique that may allow generated text to be detected. A
   small-scale study into watermarking suggests that this technique is
   feasible and show technical promise but should not be relied on as a
   solution to widespread use of artificial intelligence based tools by
   students. Alternative solutions are needed, including encouraging the
   educational community to work with artificial intelligence rather than
   against it. As such, the paper concludes by discussing seven potential

Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {411},
Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence (AI) approach
   to generate images of strain-hardening cementitious composite (SHCC)
   with complex crack patterns such as dense microcracks. This approach is
   developed to address the challenge of lacking data for training deep
   learning models used to automatically measure cracks in SHCC. The
   development of the approach is based on a framework which results in a
   hybrid generative adversarial network (HGAN) that seamlessly integrates
   a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) for
   generating images and a conditional generative adversarial network
   (CGAN) for labelling images. From the results, it was found that this
   approach provided high-quality labelled images automatically, and using
   these images significantly improved the accuracy of the deep learning
   models for measuring cracks in SHCC. The F1 score and Intersection Over
   Union (IOU) for crack segmentation reached 0.982 and 0.980,
   respectively. This approach will significantly promote crack measurement
   for SHCC materials and structures.},

Abstract = {As generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is seen as a catalyst for a
   new learning and examination culture in higher education, it urges
   universities to reinvent themselves and to adapt to these changes
   effectively. By analysing the content of 67 university guidelines on
   generative AI, this study investigates how universities in Germany
   position themselves towards the rise of generative AI. Findings reveal
   that a majority of university guidelines explicitly permit both
   university lecturers and students to engage with generative AI,
   emphasising the importance of building AI literacy among both groups and
   preparing students for changing demands in the world of work.
   Importantly, 56.7\% of university guidelines posit that the
   opportunities of generative AI for higher education outweigh the risks,
   underscoring the potential transformative impact on teaching and
   research. In addition, the results of a workshop with 25 faculty members
   were scrutinised to deepen and specify the findings of the content
   analysis.},

   use of generative AI in academic articles from three perspectives:
   AI-assisted research issue development, AI-assisted addressing of

Title = {Development and validation of generative artificial intelligence
   attitude scale for students},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Introduction Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as
   ChatGPT, have gained significant traction in educational settings,
   offering novel opportunities for enhanced learning experiences. However,
   limited research has investigated how students perceive and accept these
   emerging technologies. This study addresses this gap by developing a
   scale to assess university students' attitudes toward generative AI
   tools in education.Methods A three-stage process was employed to develop
   and validate the Generative AI Attitude Scale. Data were collected from
   664 students from various faculties during the 2022-2023 academic year.
   Expert evaluations were conducted to establish face and content
   validity. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on a subset
   of 400 participants, revealing a two-factor, 14-item structure that
   explained 78.440\% of the variance. A subsequent confirmatory factor
   analysis (CFA) was conducted on a separate sample of 264 students to
   validate this structure, resulting in the removal of one item and a
   final 13-item scale.Results The 13-item scale demonstrated strong
   reliability, evidenced by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 and a test-retest
   reliability of 0.90. Discriminative power was confirmed through
   corrected item-total correlations between lower and upper percentile
   groups. These findings indicate that the scale effectively
   differentiates student attitudes toward generative AI tools in
   educational contexts.Discussion The newly developed Generative AI
   Attitude Scale offers a valid and reliable instrument for measuring
   university students' perspectives on integrating generative AI tools,
   such as ChatGPT, into educational environments. These results highlight
   the potential for more targeted research and informed implementation
   strategies to enhance learning outcomes through generative AI.},

Journal = {AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {111},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in aquaculture have recently
   attracted growing attention, as these technologies are becoming vital
   for data analysis, improving production processes, and optimizing the
   use of natural resources. Among the different AI approaches, Generative
   Artificial Intelligence (GAI) emerges as one of the most innovative and
   promising.This paper explores the use of Generative Artificial
   Intelligence (GAI) in aquaculture, evaluating its advantages and
   challenges within the industry's unique context. It begins with an
   overview of generative model architectures, then delves into their
   potential contributions to aquatic resource management, the improvement
   of farming practices, and the promotion of environmental
   sustainability.To obtain the most upto-date insights, research was
   carried out using database such as SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Web of
   Science databases. GAI holds significant promise for aquaculture, with
   applications that include enhanced water quality management, fish stock
   health prediction, and automated feeding supervision. When applied
   responsibly, GAI can streamline routine operations while contributing to
   a more resilient and sustainable future for the aqua-culture industry.
   With its ability to extract valuable insights from big data, GAI proves
   to be a powerful tool for tackling future challenges, ensuring food
   production that meets the demands of a growing global population while
   addressing increasingly urgent environmental concerns.},

   to evolve, the lack of fluency, literacy, and effective interaction with
   Generative and conventional AI technologies are common challenges across
   all domains. Tertiary education institutions are uniquely positioned to
   address this void. In this article, we present the human-centred design
   of a universal AI literacy module, followed by its four primary
   constructs that provide core competence in AI to coursework and research
   students and academic and professional staff in a tertiary education
   setting. In comparison to related work in AI literacy, our design is

Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {88},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aims: This study aimed to explore the effects of interactive teaching
   strategies based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) under the
   guidance of outcome-based education (OBE) theory on higher-order
   thinking skills (HOTS) and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy of
   undergraduate nursing students. Background: Recently, GenAI-assisted
   teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education
   reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the
   era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to
   enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are
   limited. Design: A quasi-experimental study. Methods: Based on OBE
   theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into
   a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates
   enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66)
   and control groups (n = 66). Results: After completing the course, the
   HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P <
   0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in
   the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores
   (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group
   before and after the course. Conclusion: GenAI-assisted teaching could
   help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy. As an
   important auxiliary teaching tool, GenAI should be integrated into other
   nursing courses and widely applied in nursing education in the future.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, its
   application in the workplace has shown significant innovative potential
   and practical value. However, the existing literature lacks a systematic
   and widely applicable definition and measurement framework for
   Generative AI Literacy. Based on the existing literature and following a
   rigorous scale development process, this study constructs a Generative
   AI Literacy measurement framework that covers five core dimensions,
   basic technical competence, prompt optimization, content evaluation,
   innovative application, and ethical and compliance awareness, and
   validates its reliability and validity. Furthermore, based on the
   Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) theory, this study explores the
   mechanism through which Generative AI Literacy influences employee job
   performance and examines the mediating role of Creative Self-Efficacy.
   The results show that Generative AI Literacy has a significant positive
   impact on job performance (beta = 0.680, p < 0.001), with Creative
   Self-Efficacy playing a partial mediating role (indirect effect =
   0.537). The developed five-dimensional framework demonstrates strong
   psychometric properties and provides empirical evidence for AI
   literacy's role in enhancing workplace performance through Creative
   Self-Efficacy mechanisms. This study provides an effective measurement
   tool for research on the application of Generative AI Literacy in
   workplace settings and offers practical insights for organizations to
   optimize performance and promote the responsible use of AI.},

   and generating code for meta-analyses; (2) real-world evidence:
   generative AI can facilitate automating processes and analyze large
   collections of real-world data, including unstructured clinical notes
   and imaging; (3) health economic modeling: generative AI can aid in the
   development of health economic models, from conceptualization to
   validation. Limitations in the use of foundation models and large
   language models include challenges surrounding their scientific rigor
   and reliability, the potential for bias, implications for equity, as
   well as nontrivial concerns regarding adherence to regulatory and
   ethical standards, particularly in terms of data privacy and security.
   Additionally, we survey the current policy landscape and provide
   suggestions for HTA agencies on responsibly integrating generative AI
   into their workflows, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and
   the fast-evolving nature of these tools. Conclusions: Although
   generative AI technology holds promise with respect to HTA applications,
   it is still undergoing rapid developments and improvements. Continued
   careful evaluation of their applications to HTA is required. Both
   developers and users of research incorporating these tools, should
   familiarize themselves with their current capabilities and limitations.},

Title = {The Sound of Science: Exploring Generative AI Podcasts for Qualitative
   Health Research Translation},
Journal = {QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 8},
Abstract = {This paper contributes to ongoing conversations about the ethical and
   practical integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in
   qualitative health research by focusing on an often-overlooked aspect of
   research-dissemination. Given GAI's capacity to translate complex ideas
   into accessible summaries, simplify jargon, adapt to different
   comprehension levels, and enhance understanding through analogies, we
   explore its potential to support knowledge translation. Specifically, we
   examine the use of GAI podcasts for public-facing dissemination. Drawing
   on our experience testing three GAI-assisted podcasting platforms-with
   features ranging from automated scriptwriting to audio production-we
   assess their affordances and limitations. Our experience with these
   platforms suggests that the effectiveness of GAI depends less on the
   tools themselves and more on how researchers critically engage with and
   shape their use. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of balancing
   artificial intelligence's promise of speed and reach with concerns about
   bias, mistrust, and limited artificial intelligence literacy-recognizing
   GAI as a partner, not a substitute, in meaningful communication.},

Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has developed as an effective
   tool for time series predicting, revolutionizing the typical methods of
   prediction. Different classical approaches that depend on existing
   approaches and assumptions, generative AI controls advanced deep
   learning (DL) approaches like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
   recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to identify designs and connections in
   time series data. DL has accomplished major success in optimizing
   performances connected with AI. In the financial area, it can be
   extremely utilized for the stock market predictive, trade implementation
   approaches, and set of optimizers. Stock market predictive is the most
   important use case in this field. GANs with advanced AI approaches have
   become more significant in recent times. However, it can be utilized in
   image-image-translation and other computer vision (CV) conditions. GANs
   could not utilized greatly for stock market prediction because of their
   effort to establish the proper set of hyperparameters. This study
   develops an integrated spotted hyena optimization algorithm with
   generative artificial intelligence for time series forecasting
   (SHOAGAI-TSF) technique. The purpose of the SHOAGAI-TSF technique is to
   accomplish a forecasting process for the utilization of stock price
   prediction. The SHOAGAI-TSF technique uses probabilistic forecasting
   with a conditional GAN (CGAN) approach for the prediction of stock
   prices. The CGAN model learns the data generation distribution and
   determines the probabilistic prediction from it. To boost the prediction
   results of the CGAN approach, the hyperparameter tuning can be performed
   by the use of the SHOA. The simulation result analysis of the
   SHOAGAI-TSF technique takes place on the stock market dataset. The

Abstract = {In this paper, I take the cultural effects of generative artificial
   intelligence (generative AI) as a context for examining a broader
   perspective of AI's impact on contemporary art notions. After the
   introductory overview of generative AI, I summarize the distinct but
   often confused aspects of art notions and review the principal lines in
   which AI influences them: the strategic normalization of AI through art,
   the representation of AI art in the artworld, academia, and AI research,
   and the mutual permeability of art and kitsch in the digital culture. I
   connect these notional factors with the conceptual and ideological
   substrate of the computer science and AI industry, which blends the
   machinic agency fetishism, the equalization of computers and humans, the
   sociotechnical blindness, and cyberlibertarianism. The overtones of
   alienation, sociopathy, and misanthropy in the disparate but somehow
   coalescing philosophical premises, technical ideas, and political views
   in this substrate remain underexposed in AI studies so, in the closing
   discussion, I outline their manifestations in generative AI and
   introduce several viewpoints for a further critique of AI's cultural
   zeitgeist. They add a touch of skepticism to pondering how technological
   trends change our understanding of art and in which directions they stir
   its social, economic, and political roles.},

Journal = {CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON ACCOUNTING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {100},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article draws on the Foucauldian concept of ``discursive
   formation{''} to conceptualize generative artificial intelligence
   (GAI)'s potential influence on management. It shows how ChatGPT, a
   typical GAI, can affect practices, decision-making responsibility and
   the management disciplines through a dual discourse. The first one
   emanates from technological solutionism, a belief that any problem can
   be solved with the assistance of technology (the technosolutionist
   discourse), and the second one concerns the utterances generated by
   ChatGPT itself, which are shaped by various algorithmic, epistemic and
   linguistic influences (the generative discourse). In simpler terms, what
   ChatGPT can do to management appears to depend on ``what is said about
   it{''} and ``what it says{''}. In contrast to the existing literature on
   ChatGPT's potential influence on organizations, this article, through
   its discursive approach, takes a non-normative position, to reveal the
   subtler influences of generative artificial intelligence, and highlight
   the individual and organizational responsibilities of actors interacting
   with these two discourses. The conclusions may be of interest to
   management readers in general, and of more particular interest to the
   accounting profession, as the conceptualization is based more broadly on
   examples taken from accounting, given the close link between the

Abstract = {The rapid emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)
   presents both opportunities and risks for geographical and environmental
   education, yet educators lack structured guidance for its
   implementation. This paper develops a theoretical framework for
   integrating GenAI into geography teaching and learning, synthesising
   insights from educational technology research, geographical education
   literature, and emerging AI applications. Through analysis of academic
   and professional sources, the study examines key GenAI capabilities
   relevant to geographical education, including personalised instruction
   through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), interactive environmental
   simulations, and advanced spatial data visualisation. The proposed
   framework addresses critical challenges such as AI hallucinations,
   algorithmic bias, and spatial analysis limitations, while providing
   preliminary guidance for responsible AI adoption. This work establishes
   a foundation for future empirical research, with next steps including
   classroom-based testing and refinement of the framework across different
   educational contexts to validate its effectiveness in preserving core
   geographical thinking skills while leveraging AI capabilities.},

Abstract = {With the commercialization of ChatGPT, , generative artificial

   However, even though generative AI has become a daily technology that
   anyone can use, most non-majors need to know the process and reason for
   the results because it can be misused due to lack of sufficient
   knowledge and misunderstanding. Therefore, this study investigated
   users' preferences for when, what, and how generative AI should provide
   explanations about the process of generating and the reasoning behind
   the results, using conjoint method and mixed logit analysis. The results
   show that users are most sensitive to the timing of providing
   eXplainable AI (XAI), and that users want additional information only
   when they ask for explanations during the process of using generative
   AI. The results of this study will help shape the XAI design of future
   generative AI from a user perspective and improve usability.},

Title = {How generative Artificial Intelligence can transform drug discovery?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {295},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming drug
   discovery by enabling advanced analysis of complex biological and
   chemical data. This review explores key Generative AI models, including
   Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
   flow-based models and Transformer-based models, with Transformers
   gaining prominence due to the abundance of text-based biological data
   and the success of language models like ChatGPT. The paper discusses
   molecular representations, performance evaluation metrics, and current
   trends in Generative AI-driven drug discovery, such as protein-protein
   interactions (PPIs), drug-target interactions (DTIs) and de-novo drug
   design. However, these approaches face significant challenges, including
   applicability domain issues, lack of interpretability, data scarcity,
   novelty, scalability, computational resource limitations, and the
   absence of standardized evaluation metrics. These challenges hinder
   model performance, complicate decision-making, and limit the generation
   of novel and viable drug candidates. To address these issues, strategies
   such as hybrid models, integration of multiomics datasets, explainable
   AI (XAI) techniques, data augmentation, transfer learning, and
   cloud-based solutions are proposed. Additionally, a curated list of
   databases supporting drug discovery research is provided. The review
   concludes by emphasizing the need for optimized AI models, robust
   validation methods, interdisciplinary collaboration, and future academic
   efforts to fully realize the potential of Generative AI in advancing
   drug discovery.},

Volume = {19},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The emergence and popularity of generative artificial intelligence (AI)
   tools, particularly text-based ones known as large language models, pose
   both opportunities and challenges to education. The ability of these
   tools to generate human-like texts based on minimal instructions causes
   concerns among educators about students' use of these tools for academic
   writing, which may constitute a breach of academic integrity. We propose
   a pedagogical design that models on selfregulated learning and the
   authoring cycle and develops students' critical thinking and
   self-regulation when composing academic writing using text-based
   generative AI tools. It contains six iterative and interactive phases.
   Students first plan the content and structure of the writing, then
   generate prompts for text-based generative AI tools. Next, students
   preview and verify the tools' output, followed by the fourth phase of
   producing the writing using the corrected output. Fifthly, peer review
   by fellow students may be required to polish and proofread the writing.
   Lastly, through portfolio-tracking, students reflect on the writing
   process, and formulate strategies for future usage of text-based
   generative AI tools for writing. This pedagogical design helps students
   and teachers embrace text-based generative AI while addressing the
   perils these tools present, and guides the development of education

Abstract = {Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have emerged as potent tools for
   generating high-quality, creative content across various media,
   including audio, images, videos, and 3-D models. Their application in
   artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) marks a pivotal
   advancement in the evolution from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the
   Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Considering the inherent
   multiple-access nature of AIoT, training GDMs via federated learning and
   deploying them collaboratively is paramount. However, such approaches
   introduce considerable security risks and energy consumption challenges.
   To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive architecture for
   GDMs, encompassing both training and sampling stages. This architecture,
   termed secure and sustainable diffusion (SS-Diff), aims to thwart
   trigger-based security threats, such as backdoor attacks and trojan
   attacks, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption in
   multiple-access AIoT. The SS-Diff architecture incorporates a dynamic
   quantization mechanism within the training phase, significantly reducing
   communication overhead and thereby improving both spectrum and energy
   efficiency. During the sampling stage, a detection-based defense
   strategy is employed to identify and negate trigger inputs associated
   with malicious attacks. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the
   performance of the SS-Diff architecture. The results demonstrate that
   the SS-Diff can effectively train GDMs and eliminate the impact of the
   attacks, compared with existing schemes.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives The objective of this study was to explore the feature of
   generative artificial intelligence (AI) in asking sexual health among
   cancer survivors, which are often challenging for patients to discuss.
   Methods We employed the Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3.5 (GPT) as
   the generative AI platform and used DocsBot for citation retrieval (June
   2023). A structured prompt was devised to generate 100 questions from
   the AI, based on epidemiological survey data regarding sexual
   difficulties among cancer survivors. These questions were submitted to
   Bot1 (standard GPT) and Bot2 (sourced from two clinical guidelines).
   Results No censorship of sexual expressions or medical terms occurred.
   Despite the lack of reflection on guideline recommendations,
   `consultation' was significantly more prevalent in both bots' responses
   compared with pharmacological interventions, with ORs of 47.3 (p<0.001)
   in Bot1 and 97.2 (p<0.001) in Bot2. Discussion Generative AI can serve
   to provide health information on sensitive topics such as sexual health,
   despite the potential for policy-restricted content. Responses were
   biased towards non-pharmacological interventions, which is probably due
   to a GPT model designed with the `s prohibition policy on replying to
   medical topics. This shift warrants attention as it could potentially
   trigger patients' expectations for non-pharmacological interventions.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {239},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study proposes a game design framework using generative artificial
   intelligence based non-player character for providing simulated
   interactions and instant feedback as a metacognitive scaffolding to help
   learners develop workplace communication skills and stress resistance
   through situational experience learning. This study investigates
   learning effectiveness and psychological responses, including flow,
   perceived fidelity, cognitive load, and qualitative feedback, and
   specifically analyzes the behavioral patterns of learners interacting
   with generative artificial intelligence. A total of 91 participants were
   enrolled in this study and divided into three groups: experimental group
   1 (generative artificial intelligence interactive metacognitive
   scaffolding), experimental group 2 (video metacognitive scaffolding),
   and control group (text metacognitive scaffolding). The results showed
   that students in the generative artificial intelligence group responded
   with higher perceived fidelity and were significantly better than the
   control group with text-based metacognitive scaffolding in terms of
   learning effectiveness, flow, and germane cognitive load. Behavioral
   pattern analysis reveals that learners can effectively obtain a lot of
   positive help in solving tasks through positive interactions with
   non-player character chatbot. This framework and the findings of the
   study can be used as a reference for related studies in the field of
   game-based learning in the use of metacognitive scaffolding, contextual
   learning, and generative AI. Due to the short experimental period, the
   results may only reflect the short-term learning effects, and the
   novelty of Gen AI may also cause bias in affecting the learning
   outcomes, future studies can increase the duration or number of
   experiences, and explore the effectiveness in other professional
   domains.},

Abstract = {The growth of intelligent vehicular services, like augmented reality
   (AR) road simulation, underscores the need for rapid, multi-modal
   content generation. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models,
   known for their swift production of diverse artificial
   intelligence-generated content (AIGC), stand out as a prime solution.
   However, integrating cloud-centric GAI models into vehicular networks is
   fraught with challenges. Notably, to offer specialized generative edge
   intelligence (EI) and boost vehicular AIGC, GAI models need to tap into
   user data and utilize significant computation resources. Moreover, their
   deployment across vehicular networks is essential for proximity-based
   distributed inferences. Yet, edge devices are resource-limited, and data
   sharing can raise safety and privacy concerns. Addressing these
   challenges, this paper introduces GAI-IoV, an EI-enabled GAI framework
   facilitated through the cooperation between road-side units (RSUs) and
   vehicles. Subsequently, we propose the workflow for collaborative
   fine-tuning and distributed inference. On this basis, two pivotal
   vehicle-centric problems are then formulated: computation and
   communication resource allocation for federated fine-tuning (FFT) to
   optimize time and energy cost, and splitting strategy of shared and
   local inferences to optimize inference latency and content-generation
   capability. To solve these optimizations, we introduce a self-adaptive
   global best harmony search (SGHS) algorithm for resource allocation and
   a backward induction method for determining inference splitting
   strategy. Our experiments based on the Stable Diffusion v1-4 model vouch
   for a superior fine-tuning and inference capabilities of GAI-IoV.
   Furthermore, simulations underscore its resource utilization and
   distributed inference efficiency in dynamic vehicular scenarios.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not a recent innovation, what's new is
   how accessible its features have become across multiple devices, apps,
   and services. Sensationalistic news can distort public perception by
   exaggerating AI's capabilities and risks. This leads to misconceptions
   and unrealistic expectations, causing misunderstandings about the true
   nature and limitation of these tools. Such distortions can undermine
   trust and hinder the effective adoption and integration of AI into
   society. This study aims to address this issue by exploring the
   expectations and perceptions of young individuals regarding Generative
   Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools. It explores their understanding of
   GAI and related devices, such as virtual assistants, chatbots, and
   social robots, which can incorporate GAI. A total of N=100 university
   students engaged in this study by completing a digital questionnaire
   distributed through the virtual campus of the University of La Laguna.
   The quantitative analysis uncovered a significant gap in participants'
   understanding of GAI terminology and its underlying mechanisms.
   Additionally, it shed light on a noteworthy gender-based discrepancy in
   the expressed concerns. Participants commonly recognized their ability
   to communicate effectively with GAI, asserting that such interactions
   enhance their emotional well-being. Notably, virtual assistants and
   chatbots were perceived as more valuable tools compared to social robots
   within the educational realm.},

   AI: Discussion paper},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {75},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study is to present the possibilities of nurse
   education in the use of the Chat Generative Pretraining Transformer
   (ChatGPT) tool to support the documentation process. Background: The
   success of the nursing process is based on the accuracy of nursing
   diagnoses, which also determine nursing interventions and nursing
   outcomes. Educating nurses in the use of artificial intelligence in the
   nursing process can significantly reduce the time nurses spend on
   documentation. Design: Discussion paper. Methods: We used a case study
   from Train4Health in the field of preventive care to demonstrate the
   potential of using Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) to
   educate nurses in documenting the nursing process using generative
   artificial intelligence. Based on the case study, we entered a
   description of the patient's condition into Generative Pre -training
   Transformer (ChatGPT) and asked questions about nursing diagnoses,
   nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. We further synthesized these
   results. Results: In the process of educating nurses about the nursing
   process and nursing diagnosis, Generative Pretraining Transformer
   (ChatGPT) can present potential patient problems to nurses and guide
   them through the process from taking a medical history, setting nursing
   diagnoses and planning goals and interventions. Generative Pre -training
   Transformer (ChatGPT) returned appropriate nursing diagnoses, but these
   were not in line with the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association -
   International (NANDA-I) classification as requested. Of all the nursing
   diagnoses provided, only one was consistent with the most recent version
   of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International
   (NANDA-I). Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) is still not
   specific enough for nursing diagnoses, resulting in incorrect answers in
   several cases. Conclusions: Using Generative Pre -training Transformer
   (ChatGPT) to educate nurses and support the documentation process is
   time -efficient, but it still requires a certain level of human critical
   -thinking and factchecking.},

   this paper is divided into three parts. First, it examines the needs of
   patients in mental health. Second, it explores the potential benefits of
   GenAI in mental health and highlights the risks of its use as it
   pertains to patient needs. Third, it notes the ethical and legal
   concerns around data use and medical liability that require careful
   attention. The impact of the European Union's (EU) Artificial

Month = {2025 AUG 15},
Abstract = {Generative AI has the potential to serve as a valuable learning resource
   in programming education by offering individualized learning
   experiences, self-directed learning support, and automatic feedback.
   However, research on the factors influencing its adoption in programming
   education in students' perspectives is scarce. Thus, this study
   investigates the factors that motivate students to utilize generative AI
   as a programming learning tool. The focus is on how technophilia and
   perceived intelligence affect how students think about and use
   technology. We conducted a survey involving 410 respondents and analyzed
   the data using SmartPLS and structural equation modeling (SEM). The
   findings show that both technophilia and perceived intelligence have a
   significant impact on perceived usefulness, ease of use, trust, and
   enjoyment, all of which have an indirect effect on adoption intention.
   Furthermore, perceived usefulness, enjoyment, and trust significantly
   impact students' intention to use generative AI in programming learning,
   while perceived ease of use lacks this impact. These findings offer
   significant insights for generative AI developers and policymakers
   seeking to improve the intelligence and usability of generative AI in

Title = {Barriers to breakthroughs: A scoping review of generative AI in
   healthcare simulation},
Journal = {CLINICAL SIMULATION IN NURSING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {107},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging
   technology in healthcare education with potential to enhance simulation
   by addressing logistical barriers and by providing increased access to
   diverse settings in healthcare education, leading to improved learning
   outcomes. This rapid scoping review explores the use of generative AI in
   simulation-based education. Methods: Searches were conducted in CINAHL,
   Medline, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science using terms such as
   ``generative artificial intelligence{''} and ``healthcare
   simulation.{''} The review followed the World Health Organization (WHO)
   Rapid Review Guide and was structured using Arksey and O'Malley's
   five-stage framework for scoping reviews. Results: After applying
   inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles were included. Five themes
   emerged: (1) removal of logistical barriers, (2) authentic practice, (3)
   distinctive value, (4) limitations of generative AI, and (5) potential
   with human oversight. Generative AI improves access to simulation by
   creating cost-effective, scalable, and realistic scenarios while
   fostering critical thinking through reflective learning. However,
   challenges such as misinformation and ethical concerns remain.
   Conclusions: This scoping review identified growing momentum around
   generative AI's role in healthcare simulation. While early studies
   highlight its potential to support scalable, adaptive, and authentic
   training experiences, effective integration requires strong governance,
   ethical safeguards, and human oversight. Published by Elsevier Inc. on
   behalf of International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and

Volume = {102},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study explores university students' engagement with Generative
   Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools for creative writing and graphic
   storytelling, drawing on Jacques Rancie`re's philosophy of intellectual
   equality and emancipation. Qualitative data analysis from a
   co-curricular creative writing programme, including reflections,
   surveys, and focus-group interviews, reveals emerging artificial
   intelligence literacies and students' improvisational aptitudes for
   interpreting, subverting, and transforming notions of authorship.
   Students decentred authorial attribution through the pragmatic adoption
   of the technology as a creative catalyst, negotiated creative
   conventions by adopting non-conventional communication strategies, and
   reconceptualised creativity as distributed across human and non-human
   agents. Our approach of student-driven learning for autonomous
   exploration, sense-making, and criticality with GenAI indicates the
   potential for promoting conditions for students to exercise intellectual
   equality and emancipation. The findings contribute to the understanding
   of authorship and creativity; begin to contour emerging GenAI literacies
   and competencies; and suggest that creative collaborations with GenAI
   may be a promising way to foster emancipatory practices in the
   classroom, while nurturing creative and critical skills.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has increased in popularity in
   neurosurgery, with recent interest in generative AI algorithms such as
   the Large Language Model (LLM) ChatGPT. Sora, an innovation in

   new tool has many potential applications in neurosurgery. These include
   patient education, public health, surgical training and planning, and
   research dissemination. However, there are considerable limitations to
   the current model such as physically implausible motion generation,
   spontaneous generation of subjects, unnatural object morphing,
   inaccurate physical interactions, and abnormal behavior presentation
   when many subjects are generated. Other typical concerns are with
   respect to patient privacy, bias, and ethics. Further, appropriate
   investigation is required to determine how effective generative videos
   are compared to their non-generated counterparts, irrespective of any
   limitations. Despite these challenges, Sora and other iterations of its
   text-to-video generative application may have many benefits to the

Journal = {RESUSCITATION PLUS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aims: The aim of this study is to use generative artificial intelligence
   to perform bibliometric analysis on abstracts published at European
   Resuscitation Council (ERC) annual scientific congress and define trends
   in ERC guidelines topics over the last decade. Methods: In this
   bibliometric analysis, the WebHarvy software (SysNucleus, India) was
   used to download data from the Resuscitation journal's website through
   the technique of web scraping. Next, the Chat Generative Pre-trained
   Transformer 4 (ChatGPT-4) application programming interface (Open AI,
   USA) was used to implement the multinomial classification of abstract
   titles following the ERC 2021 guidelines topics. Results: From 2012 to
   2022 a total of 2491 abstracts have been published at ERC congresses.
   Published abstracts ranged from 88 (in 2020) to 368 (in 2015). On
   average, the most common ERC guidelines topics were Adult basic life
   support (50.1\%), followed by Adult advanced life support (41.5\%),
   while Newborn resuscitation and support of transition of infants at
   birth (2.1\%) was the least common topic. The findings also highlight
   that the Basic Life Support and Adult Advanced Life Support ERC
   guidelines topics have the strongest co-occurrence to all ERC guidelines
   topics, where the Newborn resuscitation and support of transition of
   infants at birth (2.1\%; 52/2491) ERC guidelines topic has the weakest
   co-occurrence. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the capabilities of
   generative artificial intelligence in the bibliometric analysis of
   abstract titles using the example of resuscitation medicine research
   over the last decade at ERC conferences using large language models.},

   potential biases and enable a more realistic evaluation. The research
   covers Microsoft Bing, Adobe Firefly and Leonardo AI, three popular
   artificial intelligence applications with text-to-visual conversion. The
   prompts created for the selected furniture were entered into artificial

   experimental research method and the outputs were compared. Especially
   Leonardo AI produced faster, higher-quality, and more consistent
   results. Data analysis and the potential to create designs that better
   meet user needs are features of these tools. However, in design
   processes, the role of human creativity and artistic thinking is always
   the main element. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, should be
   considered as a tool to support the creative process rather than a

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},

Number = {2},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm,
   with notable tension transpiring in the field of education. Given that
   Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this
   article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i)
   reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the
   foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in
   the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox
   theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the ``how{''}), this article (i)
   defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the
   ``ideas{''}), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the
   ``what{''}), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education
   from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the ``so what{''}).
   Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox
   \#1) Generative AI is a `friend' yet a `foe', (Paradox \#2) Generative
   AI is `capable' yet `dependent', (Paradox \#3) Generative AI is
   `accessible' yet `restrictive', and (Paradox \#4) Generative AI gets
   even `popular' when `banned' (i.e., the ``what{''}). Through a position
   that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and
   implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal
   contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should
   be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education
   reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by
   extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a
   Ragnarok that dooms the future of education of which management
   education is a part of (i.e., the ``so what{''}).},

   traditional farming practices by enabling real-time monitoring,
   automation, and data-driven decision-making. This review systematically
   examines the applications of CV in key agricultural domains, such as
   crop health monitoring, precision farming, harvesting automation, and
   livestock management, while highlighting the transformative role of
   GenAI in addressing data scarcity and enhancing model robustness.
   Advanced techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
   YOLO variants, and transformer-based architectures, are analysed for
   their effectiveness in tasks like pest detection, fruit maturity
   classification, and field management. The survey reveals that generative
   models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
   models, significantly improve dataset diversity and model
   generalisation, particularly in low-resource scenarios. However,
   challenges persist, including environmental variability, edge deployment
   limitations, and the need for interpretable systems. Emerging trends,
   such as vision-language models and federated learning, offer promising
   avenues for future research. The study concludes that the synergy of CV
   and GenAI holds immense potential for advancing smart agriculture,
   though scalable, adaptive, and trustworthy solutions remain critical for
   widespread adoption. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable
   insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to harness AI-driven
   innovations in agricultural ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence has recently seen tremendous growth, and been
   applied to several fields, including the second-language domain. In this
   article, we share an innovative practice based on one of potential
   artificial intelligence technologies for second-language teaching and
   learning - artificial intelligence-based content generator, which
   generates texts based on user's keywords. In total, 121 young
   English-as-a-foreign-language learners participated in the study, with
   half of them having engaged in the artificial intelligence-based content
   generator-based activity, and the other half having received traditional
   English-as-a-foreign-language reading instruction. We examined the
   extent to which the artificial intelligence-based content
   generator-based activity could influence the participants' foreign
   language enjoyment and interests in reading English books, and the
   participants were given the survey addressing these variables, prior to
   and after the innovative practice. It was found that the condition based
   on the artificial intelligence-based content generator-based activity
   was more effective in terms of enhancing the target variables, and that
   the group which engaged in the artificial intelligence-based content
   generator-based activity was largely in favor of artificial
   intelligence-based content generator technology. Pedagogical
   implications for employing this technology in second-language contexts
   are provided.},

Abstract = {The human ability to utilize social and behavioral cues to infer each

   central process to human social life. This ability represents a facet of
   human cognition that artificial intelligence has yet to fully mimic and
   master. Artificial agents with greater social intelligence have
   wide-ranging applications from enabling the collaboration of human-AI
   teams to more accurately modelling human behavior in complex systems.
   Here, we show that the Naive Utility Calculus generative model is
   capable of competing with leading models in intent recognition and
   action prediction when observing stag-hunt, a simple multiplayer game
   where agents must infer each other's intentions to maximize rewards.
   Moreover, we show the model is the first with the capacity to
   out-compete human observers in intent recognition after the first round
   of observation. We conclude with a discussion on implications for the
   Naive Utility Calculus and of similar generative models in general.},

Abstract = {With their diverse biological activities, peptides are promising
   candidates for therapeutic applications, showing antimicrobial,

   capabilities of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) language models

   structures for the 20 standard amino acids and an alpha-helical
   polypeptide chain, with the latter incorporating Wolfram mathematical
   computation. We also used GPT-4 to perform structural interaction
   analysis between the anti-viral nirmatrelvir and its target, the
   SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Geometric parameters of the generated
   structures typically approximated close to experimental references.
   However, modeling was sporadically error-prone and molecular complexity
   was not well tolerated. Interaction analysis further revealed the
   ability of GPT-4 to identify specific amino acid residues involved in
   ligand binding along with corresponding bond distances. Despite current
   limitations, we show the current capacity of natural language generative

   asked to report pain location and intensity during a single climbing
   session. Five generative pretrained transformer models were tasked with
   responses to the same questions. Results- Climbers identified the back
   of the forearm (19.2\%) and toes (17.3\%) as primary pain sites, with
   reported median pain intensity at 4 {[}3-5] and median maximum pain
   intensity at 7 {[}5-8]. Conversely, AI models yielded divergent
   findings, indicating fingers, hands, shoulders, legs, and feet as
   primary pain localizations with average and maximum pain intensity
   ranging from 3 to 4.4 and 5 to 10, respectively. Only two AI models
   provided references that were untraceable in PubMed and Google searches.
   Conclusion- Our findings reveal that, currently, open generative AI
   models cannot match the quality of field-collected data on acute pain in
   rock climbers. Moreover, the models generated nonexistent references,
   raising concerns about their reliability.},

Abstract = {Aiming at achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the
   metaverse, pretrained foundation models (PFMs), e.g., generative
   pretrained transformers (GPTs), can effectively provide various
   artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as autonomous driving,
   digital twins (DTs), and AI-generated content (AIGC) for extended
   reality (XR). With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving,
   serving PFMs of mobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable
   solution for caching and executing PFMs on edge servers with limited
   computing resources and GPU memory. However, PFMs typically consist of
   billions of parameters that are computation- and memory-intensive for
   edge servers during loading and execution. In this article, we
   investigate edge PFM serving problems for mobile AIGC services of the
   metaverse. First, we introduce the fundamentals of PFMs and discuss
   their characteristic fine-tuning and inference methods in edge
   intelligence. Then, we propose a novel framework of joint model caching
   and inference for managing models and allocating resources to satisfy
   users' requests efficiently. Furthermore, considering the in-context
   learning ability of PFMs, we propose a new metric to evaluate the
   freshness and relevance between examples in demonstrations and executing
   tasks, namely the Age of Context (AoC). Finally, we propose a
   least-context (LC) algorithm for managing cached models at edge servers
   by balancing the tradeoff among latency, energy consumption, and
   accuracy.},

Journal = {COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 4},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to investigate the benefits and challenges of
   integrating generative artificial intelligence, particularly ChatGPT,
   into organizational learning and development (L\&D). The research seeks
   to understand how generative AI can transform learning processes,
   enhance employee development and address potential obstacles in
   implementation. Design/methodology/approach The research uses
   semi-structured interviews with 12 L\&D industry experts to gather
   insights. Braun and Clarke's (2006) thematic analysis method was used to
   analyze the collected data. Additionally, a rigorous coding process was
   undertaken using Saldana's (2009) coding methods. Initial codes were
   generated to pinpoint significant elements within the interviews that
   could reveal insights into the influence, implications and challenges of
   integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into organizational
   L\&D. Findings The study reveals that the influence and implications of
   integrating ChatGPT include attaining more efficient and effective L\&D
   programs, boosting employee performance and enhancing their engagement
   and satisfaction. However, overreliance on ChatGPT can negatively
   influence organizational knowledge sharing and team dynamics. This study
   also found that to successfully integrate ChatGPT, organizations should
   address human-related challenges (i.e. upskilling employees with
   artificial intelligence skills) and technology-related challenges (i.e.
   data privacy violations, misinformation and ChatGPT misuse by
   employees). Originality/value This research contributes to the existing
   literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted
   impact of generative AI on organizational L\&D. It provides managers
   with advice on how to manage the integration of ChatGPT in a way that
   minimizes potential negative effects while maximizing opportunities.
   This study is also significant as it provides foundational insights into
   the capabilities of ChatGPT in organizational L\&D, stressing both its
   transformative potential and the need for careful management to prevent
   misuse.},

Abstract = {Advocates of AI in Education (AIEd) assert that the current generation
   of technologies, collectively dubbed artificial intelligence, including
   generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), promise results that can
   transform our conceptions of what education looks like. Therefore, it is
   imperative to investigate how educators perceive GenAI and its potential
   use and future impact on education. Adopting the methodology of
   collective writing as an inquiry, this study reports on the
   participating educators' perceived grey areas (i.e. issues that are
   unclear and/or controversial) and recommendations on future research.
   The grey areas reported cover decision-making on the use of GenAI, AI
   ethics, appropriate levels of use of GenAI in education, impact on
   learning and teaching, policy, data, GenAI outputs, humans in the loop
   and public-private partnerships. Recommended directions for future
   research include learning and teaching, ethical and legal implications,
   ownership/authorship, funding, technology, research support, AI metaphor
   and types of research. Each theme or subtheme is presented in the form
   of a statement, followed by a justification. These findings serve as a
   call to action to encourage a continuing debate around GenAI and to
   engage more educators in research. The paper concludes that unless we
   can ask the right questions now, we may find that, in the pursuit of
   greater efficiency, we have lost the very essence of what it means to

   methods},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {174},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic review of generative artificial
   intelligence (AI) use in architectural design from 2014 to 2024,
   focusing on 1) AI models and theory-application gaps, 2) design phases,
   tasks, and objectives, 3) data types and contents, and 4) evaluation
   methods. Based on 161 journal papers selected using preferred reporting
   items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA), the analysis
   reveals the theory-application gap has been reduced by 96.09 \%, from 62
   to 2.5 years, highlighting rapid AI adoption since 2021 with generative
   adversarial networks (GANs) leading, and transformers and diffusion
   models gaining traction. For its application, AI is employed in
   schematic design phases in 68.94 \%, while later phases remain
   underexplored. Regarding types of data used, images dominate at both
   input (52.8 \%) and output (68.32 \%), with multimodal and graph data
   showing promise. For evaluation, comparative evaluation was most
   utilized (60.9 \%) supported by subjective assessment by authors (34.2
   \%) and third parties (17.4 \%).},

Title = {Artificial intelligence and innovation management: Charting the evolving
   landscape},
Journal = {TECHNOVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {136},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The excitement surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) is palpable. It
   is rapidly gaining prevalence in academia, business, and personal use.
   In particular, the emergence of generative AI, exemplified by large
   language models such as ChatGPT, has been marked by substantial media
   attention, discourse, and hype. Like most, if not all, aspects of
   business, innovation processes have been impacted. However, little is
   known about the degree of impact or the benefits that might be gained.
   To cut through the hype and understand the use of AI in innovation
   processes in businesses today, a large-scale survey amongst innovation
   managers in the USA was conducted, followed by interviews. The findings
   indicate that the use of AI in innovation processes is high and
   widespread, with AI being used for more than half of the surveyed firms'
   innovation projects. Furthermore, AI is used more in the development
   stage of the innovation process than in the idea or commercialization
   stages, which counters much of the existing discourse, which focuses on
   the idea stage. We uncover interesting differences by comparing the use
   and impact of generative AI with that of more traditional AI. Among
   these is a significant difference in expected benefits in making
   employees' jobs more fulfilling - managers believe generative AI is more
   likely to confer this benefit than traditional AI. This paper offers two
   valuable contributions. First, it enriches the evolving dialogue at the
   intersection of AI and innovation management by offering much-needed
   empirical evidence about practical applications. Second, it provides
   timely managerial implications by examining relationships between the
   use of AI and innovation performance and understanding the benefits that
   AI can confer in the innovation process.},

   adversarial network},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATERIALS INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Discovering novel crystals is a highly effective way to develop new
   materials, though it presents significant challenges. Recently, many
   artificial intelligence (AI) generative methods have been developed to
   generate new crystals. In this work, we present a crystal generative
   framework based on Wyckoff generative adversarial network (CGWGAN) to
   efficiently discover novel crystals. The CGWGAN includes three modules:
   a generator of crystal templates, an atom-infill module, and a crystal
   screening module. The generator uses a generative adversarial network
   (GAN) to produce crystal templates embedded with asymmetry units (ASUs),
   space groups, lattice vectors, and the total number of atoms within the
   lattice cell, ensuring that the generated templates precisely match all
   requirements of crystals. These templates become crystal candidates
   after filling in atoms of different chemical elements. These candidates
   are screened by M3GNet and the passed ones are subjected to density
   functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to finally verify their
   stability. As a showcase, the CGWGAN successfully discovers seven novel
   crystals within the Ba-Ru-O system, demonstrating its effectiveness.
   This work provides a knowledge-guided Artificial Intelligence generative
   framework for accelerating crystal discovery.},

   Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {31576-31588},
Abstract = {Humans possess the remarkable capacity to comprehend narratives
   presented in text and subsequently conjure associated mental images
   through their imagination. This cognitive ability enhances their grasp
   of the content and augments their overall enjoyment. Consequently, the
   development of an automated system aimed at producing visually faithful
   images based on textual descriptions, often referred to as the
   text-to-image task, stands as a profoundly meaningful endeavor. For this
   reason, a variety of text-to-image generating artificial intelligences
   (AIs) have been devised until now. Nevertheless, the generative AIs
   introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold
   the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences
   are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge
   through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental
   results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively
   preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison
   to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves
   performance by at least 30 percent in terms of the similarity of the
   generated image and by 130 percent in terms of ROUGE(recall) .},

Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI)
   into library systems is transforming the global information society,
   offering new possibilities for improving information access, management,
   and dissemination. However, these advancements also raise significant
   ethical concerns, including algorithmic bias, epistemic injustice,

   It argues that while such concerns are global, they are particularly
   acute in the Global South, where structural barriers such as skills
   shortages, weak policy frameworks, and limited infrastructure undermine
   equitable access to AI benefits. The review calls for a more inclusive,
   transparent, and ethically responsible approach to AI adoption in

Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Introduction: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has become more
   accessible due to technological advancements. While it can support more
   efficient learning, improper use may lead to legal issues or hinder
   self-directed learning. Medical education is no exception, as generative
   AI has the potential to become a powerful tool. However, its
   practicality remains uncertain. Therefore, we investigated how
   generative AI is perceived among medical students and utilized within
   the realm of medical education. Methods: In January 2024, we conducted a
   study with 123 second-year medical students who had completed a
   physiology course and laboratory training at Gunma University, Japan.
   Students used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) 3.5
   (OpenAI) for four tasks and evaluated its responses. A survey on the use
   of generative AI was also conducted. Responses from 117 participants
   were analyzed, excluding six non-participants. Results: Among the
   students, 41.9\% had used ChatGPT. The average scores for tasks 1-4 were
   6.5, 4.6, 7.4, and 6.2 out of 10, respectively. Although 13\% had a
   negative impression, 54 students found it challenging to apply for
   medical purposes. However, 64.1\% expressed a willingness to continue
   using generative AI, provided its use extended beyond medical contexts.
   Conclusions: Nearly 60\% of students had never used generative AI
   before, which is consistent with general usage trends. Although they
   were impressed by the speed of generative AI responses, many students
   found that it lacked precision for medical studies and required
   additional verification. Limitations of generative AI, such as
   ``hallucinations,{''} were evident in medical education. It remains
   important to educate students on AI literacy and their understanding of
   the potential issues that generative AI could bring about.},

   with much of it focused on automation and its impact in terms of
   potential job losses. This review will address one area where AI is
   being added to creative and design practitioners' toolbox to enhance
   their creativity, productivity, and design horizons. A designer's
   primary purpose is to create, or generate, the most optimal artifact or

   this space with the advent of generative networks and generative
   adversarial networks (GANs) in particular. This area has become one of
   the most active research fields in machine learning over the past number
   of years, and a number of these techniques, particularly those around
   plausible image generation, have garnered considerable media attention.
   We will look beyond automatic techniques and solutions and see how GANs

   systematic review of publications indexed on ScienceDirect,
   SpringerLink, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEExplore, and ACM DigitalLibrary

   The studies' limitations are presented, particularly a lack of user
   studies and the prevalence of toy-examples or implementations that are
   unlikely to scale. Areas for future study are also identified.},

Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is boosting anticipatory forms

   are large-scale AIs residing in vast digital urban platforms, which
   manage multiple urban domains including transport, safety, health, and

   we focus on technocratic approaches to anticipatory governance, to
   explain how the act of governing extends into the future by means of
   predictive AI technology. Our approach is critical in order to expose
   the dangers that the use of AI (generative AI, in particular) in urban
   governance poses, and to identify their causes. These dangers include
   the formation of a policy process that, under the influence of
   unintelligible LLMs, risks losing transparency and thus accountability,
   and the marginalization of human stakeholders (citizens, in particular)
   as the role of AI in the management of cities keeps growing and
   governance begins to turn posthuman. Empirically, we critically examine
   an existing city brain project under development in China and ground our
   critical theory in a real-life example.},

Journal = {KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-126},
Abstract = {This paper aims to verify whether Generative Artificial Intelligence
   tools for image generation replicate biases and social stereotypes
   present in the dominant paradigm. A case study was carried out using the
   Leonardo.Ai tool, which generated images using simple combined terms,
   namely: ``Scientist, person{''}; ``Cook, person{''}; ``Doctor,
   person{''}; ``CEO, person{''}; ``Housekeeper, person{''}; and ``Nurse,
   person{''}. The images were analyzed using Rodrigues' (2007) image
   documentary analysis methodology and Gemma Penn's (2008) contributions.
   The analysis criteria included gender, age group, ethnicity, body type,
   clothes, and circumscribed elements. The images generated by the
   Leonardo.Ai tool were found to have a series of characteristics that
   perpetuate bias and social stereotypes. Given the likely impact that
   generative Artificial Intelligence will have on the production and
   sharing of information, we conclude that, in addition to the ethical
   issues related to the creation of the tool itself, there is a need to
   discuss ways of making it more inclusive and responsible for the
   representation of information.},

Abstract = {As an emerging research area since generative artificial intelligence
   (represented by Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT)) has
   been accessible to the public, especially in education, appropriate AI
   application could bring numerous benefits to education; however, its
   abuse has the potential to be harmful. In this paper, we aimed to
   explore the potential of AI in the future of education with the
   analytical method of evolutionary game analysis (EGA). By studying the
   behavior of two agents, the school and the students, EGA can be used to
   identify strategies that can be used to improve the effectiveness of the
   education model in the context of the AI era. A stable evolutionary
   strategy for the school and students was devised under a variety of
   scenarios. Additionally, we conducted a numerical analysis to further
   explore the impact of several key factors on the stable strategy. The
   results indicated that schools should adopt positive supervision to
   standardize the use of AI in education, and students should be more
   active in becoming involved in AI technology. Based on this study, we
   believe that the school has the ability to provide effective suggestions
   and practical guidelines to help students succeed academically and

Abstract = {This paper is a systematic literature review (SLR) on generative
   artificial intelligence in education, with the aim of analysing whether
   Chat GPT specifically contributes to the construction of a more just,
   democratic and transformative education system or, on the contrary, is a
   brake on it. Fifty-three published and peer-reviewed papers have been
   reviewed between 2023 and 2025 in the most well-known reference
   databases: Web of Science, Scopus and Dialnet. The results obtained show
   two main trends in positions on generative AI in education: modernising
   technooptimism; scepticism and critical perspectives on commodification,
   exclusion and inequity in AI. The conclusions point out that its
   incorporation into education does not represent a substantial
   improvement or a relevant contribution to a fairer and more democratic
   education and even warns of the possibility of a greater concentration
   of influence of a small group of private actors in the education policy
   and practice. The limitations of this SLR include the difficulty of
   comprehensively addressing the in-depth analysis of a recent and rapidly
   developing phenomenon.},

   concerns that may prove informative for theoretical discussions and
   applied research on generative AI as a collaborative thought partner.
   Each of these considerations is informed and inspired by well-worn
   psychological research on knowledge acquisition. They are (a) a need to
   understand human perceptions of and responses to AI, (b) the utility of
   appraising and supporting people's control of AI, and (c) the importance
   of careful attention to the quality of AI output.},

Abstract = {Manufacturing enterprises are facing how to utilise industrial knowledge

   Recently, artificial intelligence-generative content has achieved great

   industrial generative pre-trained Transformer (Industrial-GPT) for
   intelligent manufacturing systems is introduced to solve various
   scenario tasks. It refers to pre-training with industrial datasets,
   fine-tuning with industrial scenarios, and reinforcement learning with
   domain knowledge. To enable Industrial-GPT to better empower the
   manufacturing industry, Model as a Service is introduced to cloud
   computing as a new service mode, which provides a more efficient and
   flexible service approach by directly invoking the general model of the
   upper layer and customising it for specific businesses. Then, the
   operation mechanism of the Industrial-GPT driven intelligent
   manufacturing system is described. Finally, the challenges and prospects
   of applying the Industrial-GPT in the manufacturing industry are

   Realm of Generative Art},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY OF AESTHETICS CREATIVITY AND THE ARTS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 27},
Abstract = {Several decades ago, J. P. Guilford (1950) speculated that, although
   artificial intelligence (AI) might one day take over much of human
   thinking, creativity would remain a uniquely human faculty. However,
   rapid advancements in AI have led to the recent development of
   generative models that are capable of producing high-quality creative
   products, casting some doubt Guilford's prediction. Here, to shed light
   on this issue, we explored whether human creativity retains distinct
   value in the emerging domain of AI-assisted digital artworks. Using
   DALL-E 3, we generated images based on prompts crafted by professional
   artists, novice artists, and an AI chatbot (ChatGPT-4). Creativity
   ratings from 299 participants showed that images produced from
   professional artist prompts were rated as most creative, followed by
   those generated from AI chatbot prompts, with novice artist prompts
   rated lowest. Further analysis suggested that this pattern may be
   partially explained by the semantic distance of the prompts, which
   followed the same pattern (i.e., professionals > AI chatbot > novices).
   These findings suggest that, although AI demonstrates impressive
   creative abilities, the worth of human creativity has not been
   diminished in the domain of AI-assisted outputs, which supports
   Guilford's view on the enduring value of human creativity.},

   Instruction in Higher Education: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {ARAB WORLD ENGLISH JOURNAL},

Number = {SI},
Pages = {26-55},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With the growth of Artificial Intelligence technologies, there is
   interest in studying their potential impact on university academic
   writing courses. This study examined whether AI tools are replacing
   these courses by exploring how they effectively replace traditional
   academic writing instruction and this shift's potential benefits and
   drawbacks. The researcher reviewed existing literature on integrating AI
   tools into academic writing instruction. The findings provide insights
   to educators navigating the integration of Artificial Intelligence tools
   into writing curricula while maintaining instructional quality and
   academic integrity standards. By synthesizing the latest research, this
   study can inform decisions about the appropriate use of Artificial
   Intelligence in teaching essential writing skills. Increased use of
   Artificial Intelligence writing tools has sparked debate about their
   role in academic writing instruction. Universities like Stanford have
   updated policies around Artificial Intelligence tool usage and academic
   integrity. The University of California issued guidance acknowledging
   the prevalence of generative Artificial Intelligence on campuses.
   Middlebury College banned classroom use of ChatGPT over concerns it
   could impede critical thinking and writing skill development. Results
   show that while Artificial Intelligence helps with grammar and style,
   questions remain about its impact on creativity and critical thinking.
   However, Artificial Intelligence is not replacing university writing
   courses. These courses teach critical thinking, research, citation,
   argumentation, creativity, originality, and ethics, which Artificial
   Intelligence lacks. Academic writing courses offer a complete learning
   experience. Artificial Intelligence may improve academic writing but is
   unlikely to replace traditional courses soon. A balanced approach
   integrating Artificial Intelligence support while preserving core
   elements of academic writing education appears most effective for
   preparing students for diverse writing challenges.},

Abstract = {Deterministic pseudorandom number generators used in generative

   vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. Conventional defenses against
   the vulnerabilities often come with significant energy and latency
   overhead. Herein, hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer

   minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
   adversarial network trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up
   to 18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG)
   baseline. With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and
   established scalability, the STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to

Abstract = {While generative artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential in
   medical diagnostics, comprehensive evaluation of its diagnostic
   performance and comparison with physicians has not been extensively
   explored. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies
   validating generative AI models for diagnostic tasks published between
   June 2018 and June 2024. Analysis of 83 studies revealed an overall
   diagnostic accuracy of 52.1\%. No significant performance difference was
   found between AI models and physicians overall (p = 0.10) or non-expert
   physicians (p = 0.93). However, AI models performed significantly worse
   than expert physicians (p = 0.007). Several models demonstrated slightly
   higher performance compared to non-experts, although the differences
   were not significant. Generative AI demonstrates promising diagnostic
   capabilities with accuracy varying by model. Although it has not yet
   achieved expert-level reliability, these findings suggest potential for
   enhancing healthcare delivery and medical education when implemented
   with appropriate understanding of its limitations.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) means we
   are witnessing transformative change in education. While GenAI offers
   exciting possibilities for personalised learning and innovative teaching
   methodologies, its potential for reinforcing biases and perpetuating
   stereotypes poses ethical and pedagogical concerns. This article aims to
   critically examine the images produced by the integration of DALL-E 3
   and ChatGPT, focusing on representations of science classrooms and
   educators. Applying a capital lens, we analyse how these images portray
   forms of culture (embodied, objectified and institutionalised) and
   explore if these depictions align with, or contest, stereotypical
   representations of science education. The science classroom imagery
   showcased a variety of settings, from what the GenAI described as
   vintage to contemporary. Our findings reveal the presence of
   stereotypical elements associated with science educators, including
   white-lab coats, goggles and beakers. While the images often align with
   stereotypical views, they also introduce elements of diversity. This
   article highlights the importance for ongoing vigilance about issues of
   equity, representation, bias and transparency in GenAI artefacts. This
   study contributes to broader discourses about the impact of GenAI in
   reinforcing or dismantling stereotypes associated with science

Number = {3},
Pages = {444-452},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers
   transformative potential in the field of education. The study explores
   three main areas: (1) How did ChatGPT answer questions related to
   science education? (2) What are some ways educators could utilise
   ChatGPT in their science pedagogy? and (3) How has ChatGPT been utilised
   in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research
   tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to
   investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT's output often aligned
   with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands,
   ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic
   authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in
   evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical
   concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact,
   issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright
   infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of
   ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations.
   ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science
   units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any
   AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts.
   ChatGPT was used as a research tool for assistance with editing and to
   experiment with making the research narrative clearer. The intention of
   the paper is to act as a catalyst for a broader conversation about the
   use of generative AI in science education.},

Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Feedback is an essential component of the teaching-learning process;
   however, it can vary in quality due to different contexts and students'
   and professors' individual characteristics. This research explores the
   effect of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in strengthening
   personalized and timely feedback by initially defining an adaptable
   framework to integrate GenAI into feedback mechanisms defined in
   theoretical frameworks. We applied a between-subjects analysis in an
   experimental research design with 263 undergraduate students across
   multiple disciplines based on an approach consisting of a
   pretest-post-test process and control and focus groups to evaluate
   students' perceptions of artificial intelligence-enhanced feedback
   versus traditional professor-led feedback. The results show that
   students who used GenAI declared statistically significantly higher
   satisfaction levels and a greater sense of ownership in the feedback
   process. Additionally, GenAI scaffolded continuous improvement and
   active student participation through a structured and accessible
   feedback environment, determining that 97\% of students are willing to
   reuse the tool. These findings show that GenAI is a valuable tool to
   complement professors in the creation of an integrated feedback model.

Abstract = {Purpose: This cross-sectional study assessed a generative artificial
   intelligence platform to automate the creation of accurate, appropriate,
   and compelling social media (SoMe) posts from urological journal
   articles. Materials and Methods: One hundred SoMe posts from the top 3
   journals in urology X (formerly Twitter) profiles were collected from
   August 2022 to October 2023. A freeware generative pre-trained
   transformer (GPT) tool was developed to autogenerate SoMe posts, which
   included title summarization, key findings, pertinent emojis, hashtags,
   and digital object identifier links to the article. Three physicians
   independently evaluated GPT-generated posts for achieving tetrafecta of
   accuracy and appropriateness criteria. Fifteen scenarios were created
   from 5 randomly selected posts from each journal. Each scenario
   contained both the original and the GPT-generated post for the same
   article. Five questions were formulated to investigate the posts'
   likability, shareability, engagement, understandability, and
   comprehensiveness. The paired posts were then randomized and presented
   to blinded academic authors and general public through Amazon Mechanical
   Turk (AMT) responders for preference evaluation. Results: Median time
   for post autogeneration was 10.2 seconds (interquartile range 8.5-12.5).
   Of the 150 rated GPT-generated posts, 115 (76.6\%) met the correctness
   tetrafecta: 144 (96\%) accurately summarized the title, 147 (98\%)
   accurately presented the articles' main findings, 131 (87.3\%)
   appropriately used emojis, and 138 (92\%) appropriately used hashtags. A
   total of 258 academic urologists and 493 AMT responders answered the
   surveys, wherein the GPT-generated posts consistently outperformed the
   original journals' posts for both academicians and AMT responders (P <
   .05). Conclusions: Generative artificial intelligence can automate the
   creation of SoMe posts from urology journal abstracts that are both
   accurate and preferable by the academic community and general public.},

   this new technology poses. This paper examines the priorities and
   challenges that senior Australian educational leaders identify with
   relation to responsible and ethical use of generative AI in school
   education, and the reasons for their beliefs. Members of the Australian
   generative Artificial Intelligence in Education working group as well as
   other senior policymakers throughout Australia participated in a
   two-phase data collection process involving survey responses and focus
   group discussions. Ranking activities revealed a large number of
   priorities and systemic challenges, with no unilateral consensuses

   managing risks, educating teachers, and educating system leaders, while
   the main systemic and environmental challenges related to the pace of
   change, teacher capabilities and professional learning, and equitable
   access to the technology. Throughout the analysis, meta themes emerged
   that characterised the policy-setting environment as one involving
   urgency, uncertainty, interconnectedness, contextuality, and complexity,

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {1353-1366},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is widely recognized as one of
   the most influential technologies for the future, having sparked a
   paradigm shift in scientific research. The field of education has also
   been greatly impacted by this transformative technology, with
   researchers exploring the applications of generative AI, particularly
   ChatGPT, in education. However, existing research primarily focuses on
   generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of
   studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key
   challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we
   present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational
   videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need
   for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main
   modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video
   generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation
   system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text
   generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation,
   text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy
   of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation
   system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent
   text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical
   findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that
   exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a
   better comprehension of the poem's connotations and its key components.
   Concurrently, the Tang poetry videos generated can significantly
   contribute to the reduction of cognitive load and the enhancement of
   understanding during the learning process. Our research showcases the
   potential of generative AI in the education field, specifically in the
   domain of multimodal teaching resources.},

Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 4},
Abstract = {The purpose of this work is to explore methods of visual communication
   based on generative artificial intelligence in the context of new media.
   This work proposes an image automatic generation and recognition model
   that integrates the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)
   with the Transformer algorithm. The generator component of the model
   takes noise vectors and conditional variables as inputs. Subsequently, a
   Transformer module is incorporated, where the multi-head self-attention
   mechanism enables the model to establish complex relationships among
   different data points. This is further refined through linear
   transformations and activation functions to enhance feature
   representations. Ultimately, the self-attention mechanism captures the
   long-range dependencies within images, facilitating the generation of
   high-quality images that meet specific conditions. The model's
   performance is assessed, and the findings show that the accuracy of the
   proposed model reaches 95.69\%, exceeding the baseline algorithm
   Generative Adversarial Network by more than 4\%. Additionally, the Peak
   Signal-to-Noise Ratio of the model's algorithm is 33dB, and the
   Structural Similarity Index is 0.83, indicating higher image generation
   quality and recognition accuracy. Therefore, the model proposed achieves
   high recognition and prediction accuracy of generated images, and higher
   image quality, promising significant application value in visual
   communication in the new media era.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) is a new technology
   with potentially broad applications across important domains of
   healthcare, but serious questions remain about how to balance the
   promise of generative AI against unintended consequences from adoption
   of these tools. In this position statement, we provide recommendations
   on behalf of the Society of General Internal Medicine on how clinicians,
   technologists, and healthcare organizations can approach the use of
   these tools. We focus on three major domains of medical practice where
   clinicians and technology experts believe generative AI will have
   substantial immediate and long-term impacts: clinical decision-making,
   health systems optimization, and the patient-physician relationship.
   Additionally, we highlight our most important generative AI ethics and
   equity considerations for these stakeholders. For clinicians, we
   recommend approaching generative AI similarly to other important
   biomedical advancements, critically appraising its evidence and utility
   and incorporating it thoughtfully into practice. For technologists
   developing generative AI for healthcare applications, we recommend a
   major frameshift in thinking away from the expectation that clinicians
   will ``supervise{''} generative AI. Rather, these organizations and
   individuals should hold themselves and their technologies to the same
   set of high standards expected of the clinical workforce and strive to
   design high-performing, well-studied tools that improve care and foster
   the therapeutic relationship, not simply those that improve efficiency
   or market share. We further recommend deep and ongoing partnerships with
   clinicians and patients as necessary collaborators in this work. And for
   healthcare organizations, we recommend pursuing a combination of both
   incremental and transformative change with generative AI, directing
   resources toward both endeavors, and avoiding the urge to rapidly
   displace the human clinical workforce with generative AI. We affirm that
   the practice of medicine remains a fundamentally human endeavor which
   should be enhanced by technology, not displaced by it.},

Title = {Generative AI of things for sustainable smart cities: Synergizing
   cognitive augmentation, resource efficiency, network traffic,

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {133},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has emerged as a transformative
   technology driving environmental sustainability in smart city
   development. However, the integration of Generative Artificial
   Intelligence (GenAI) within AIoT ecosystems remains largely unexplored.
   Current research predominantly addresses conventional AIoT frameworks,
   overlooking the innovative potential of generative models, such as
   Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, Diffusion
   Models, Transformers, and hybrid architectures, to significantly enhance
   situational awareness, system optimization, operational robustness,
   real-time responsiveness, and adaptive decision-making in complex urban
   environments. AIoT systems continue to face persistent challenges,
   including data scarcity, poor data quality, limited adaptability,
   imbalanced datasets, and inadequate contextawareness. This study
   addresses these gaps by systematically exploring how GenAI can enhance
   AIoT functionalities across key domains-namely cognitive augmentation,
   resource efficiency, network traffic, cybersecurity, and anomaly
   detection-while examining their synergistic potential to improve
   system-level environmental performance across two interconnected layers
   in sustainable smart cities. At the operational layer, key findings
   reveal that integrating GenAI with AIoT systems enhances urban
   efficiency, adaptability, autonomy, robustness, and resilience by
   conserving resources, optimizing network traffic flows, securing
   infrastructures, and detecting anomalies before they escalate.
   Specifically, the fusion of generative intelligence with federated
   learning promotes sustainable, energy-efficient AIoT deployments by
   reducing data transmission, thereby lowering communication overhead and
   safeguarding user privacy. In networked environments, generative models
   improve synthetic traffic realism and communication efficiency. They
   also strengthen cybersecurity through enhanced intrusion prevention and
   threat detection. Additionally, they enable early identification and
   mitigation of anomalies, boosting operational efficiency and system
   robustness. These improvements stabilize sustainable smart city system
   functioning and prevent disruptive failures. At the environmental layer,
   as key findings indicate, these operational gains cascade into indirect
   but tangible ecological benefits, while generative models advance the
   core pillars of AIoT by enabling proactive, autonomous, context-aware,
   and self-adaptive systems that further enhance the environmental
   performance of sustainable smart cities. Thus, while the five domains
   primarily underpin the operational backbone of urban systems, their
   cascading effects extend to ecological outcomes. The proposed conceptual
   framework, distilled from key findings, integrates GenAI and AIoT and
   highlights both domain-specific advancements and their synergistic
   interactions. This framework holds significant potential to drive
   sustainable smart city development by fostering AIoT ecosystems that are
   more intelligent, resource-efficient, adaptive, secure, robust, and
   autonomous through the strategic application of generative intelligence.
   The insights gained from this study provide policymakers, urban
   planners, system designers, and technology developers with practical
   guidance to harness GAIoT for enhancing smart city resilience,
   sustainability, and operational intelligence.},

Abstract = {This study examined generative artificial intelligences (GenAIs), as
   popularized by ChatGPT, in standardized creativity tests. Benchmarking
   GenAI against human performance, the results showed that ChatGPT
   demonstrated remarkable fluency in content generation, though the
   creative output was average. The random nature of AI creativity and the
   dependency on the richness of the training database require a
   reassessment of traditional creativity metrics, especially for AI. Our
   findings highlight the integral role humans play in guiding AI to foster
   genuine originality, suggesting the need for future research in human-AI
   co-creation and the development of robust AI creativity measurement
   mechanisms.},

Month = {2024 DEC 9},
Abstract = {This multidisciplinary and multi-perspective review, based on more than
   50 editorials and studies published in the last two years, explores the
   transformative impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on
   academic publishing. While GenAI has streamlined tasks such as
   summarizing literature and drafting manuscripts, it has also introduced
   significant ethical and practical challenges. Key concerns include
   authorship, where GenAI falls short of meeting intellectual or
   accountability criteria, as well as the increasing threat of plagiarism,
   originality issues, and the spread of misinformation. The review also
   highlights biases embedded in GenAI generated content and the
   implications for academic fairness and inclusivity. Additionally, it
   addresses transparency and accountability challenges in AI use within
   academic environments. Through a synthesis of these diverse perspectives
   and presentation of a model that posits an ecosystem that governs AI
   policy and publications, this review advocates for comprehensive
   guidelines and emphasizes the critical need for human oversight to
   ensure responsible AI use, balancing its potential efficiencies with the
   integrity and rigor of academic publishing.},

Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has recently emerged as a
   promising solution to address critical challenges of blockchain
   technology, including scalability, security, privacy, and
   interoperability. In this paper, we first introduce GAI techniques,
   outline their applications, and discuss existing solutions for
   integrating GAI into blockchains. Then, we discuss emerging solutions
   that demonstrate the effectiveness of GAI in addressing various
   challenges of blockchain, such as detecting unknown blockchain attacks
   and smart contract vulnerabilities, designing key secret sharing
   schemes, and enhancing privacy. Moreover, we present a case study to
   demonstrate that GAI, specifically the generative diffusion model, can
   be employed to optimize blockchain network performance metrics.
   Experimental results clearly show that, compared to a baseline
   traditional AI approach, the proposed generative diffusion model
   approach can converge faster, achieve higher rewards, and significantly
   improve the throughput and latency of the blockchain network.
   Additionally, we highlight future research directions for GAI in
   blockchain applications, including personalized GAI-enabled blockchains,
   GAI-blockchain synergy, and privacy and security considerations within

Abstract = {The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
   attracted global attention and posed challenges to existing data
   governance frameworks. The increased technical complexity and expanded
   scale of data usage not only make it more difficult to regulate AI but

   that while China's governance on privacy and personal data protection
   takes a macro-micro integration approach and a private-and-public law
   integration approach, there are shortcomings in the legal system. Given
   that the current personal data protection system centered on individual
   control is unsuitable for the modes of data processing by generative AI,
   and that private law is insufficient in safeguarding data privacy,
   urgent institutional innovation is needed to achieve the objective of

Abstract = {Generative design tools empowered by recent advancements in artificial

   conducted with practicing and student designers from different
   disciplines who use commercial generative design tools, detailing the
   design processes they followed. From a grounded theory-based analysis of
   the interviews, a provisional process diagram for generative design and
   its uses in the early-stage design process is proposed. The early stages
   of defining tool inputs bring about a constraint-driven process in which
   designers focus on the abstraction of the design problem. Designers will
   iterate through the inputs to improve both quantitative and qualitative
   metrics. The learning through iteration allows designers to gain a
   thorough understanding of the design problem and solution space. This
   can bring about creative applications of generative design tools in
   early-stage design to provide guidance for traditionally designed

   research examines the effects of generative AI (ChatGPT-4) and social
   media use on young students' academic performance and psychological
   well-being, focusing on CL. The study conceptual framework was examined
   based on a sample of 441 Chinese university students. The statistical
   technique PLS-SEM is put into practice to measure the structural
   framework of academic performance and psychological well-being. The
   findings of this study show that generative AI (ChatGPT-4) and social

Pages = {1-14},
Abstract = {The introduction of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
   revolutionized healthcare and education. These AI systems, trained on
   vast datasets using advanced machine learning (ML) techniques and large
   language models (LLMs), can generate text, images, and videos, offering
   new avenues for enhancing surgical education. Their ability to produce
   interactive learning resources, procedural guidance, and feedback
   post-virtual simulations makes them valuable in educating surgical
   trainees. However, technical challenges such as data quality issues,
   inaccuracies, and uncertainties around model interpretability remain
   barriers to widespread adoption. This review explores the integration of
   generative AI into surgical training, assessing its potential to enhance
   learning and teaching methodologies. While generative AI has
   demonstrated promise for improving surgical education, its integration
   must be approached cautiously, ensuring AI input is balanced with
   traditional supervision and mentorship from experienced surgeons. Given
   that generative AI models are not yet suitable as standalone tools, a
   blended learning approach that integrates AI capabilities with
   conventional educational strategies should be adopted. The review also
   addresses limitations and challenges, emphasizing the need for more
   robust research on different AI models and their applications across
   various surgical subspecialties. The lack of standardized frameworks and
   tools to assess the quality of AI outputs in surgical education
   necessitates rigorous oversight to ensure accuracy and reliability in
   training settings. By evaluating the current state of generative AI in
   surgical education, this narrative review highlights the potential for
   future innovation and research, encouraging ongoing exploration of AI in

   literacy, and perceived trust. Data were gathered from a sample of 237
   university teachers through a structured questionnaire. The study
   employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine the
   relationships among the constructs. The results revealed that both AI
   literacy and perceived ease were the most influential factors affecting
   teachers' acceptance of GenAI. Notably, intelligent TPACK and perceived
   trust were found to be pivotal mediators in this relationship. The
   findings underscore the importance of fostering AI literacy and adapting
   intelligent TPACK frameworks to better equip educators in the age of AI.
   Furthermore, there is a clear need for targeted professional development
   initiatives focusing on practical training that enhances AI literacy.
   These programs should provide hands-on experience with GenAI tools,
   boosting educators' confidence and ability to integrate them into their
   teaching practices.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is emerging as a disruptive
   force, both economically and socially, with its use spanning from the
   provision of goods and services to everyday activities such as
   healthcare and household management. This study analyzes the enabling
   and inhibiting factors of GAI use in Spain based on a large-scale survey
   conducted by the Spanish Center for Sociological Research on the use and
   perception of artificial intelligence. The proposed model is based on
   the Theory of Planned Behavior and is fitted using machine learning
   techniques, specifically decision trees, Random Forest extensions, and
   extreme gradient boosting. While decision trees allow for detailed
   visualization of how variables interact to explain usage, Random Forest
   provides an excellent model fit (R2 close to 95\%) and predictive
   performance. The use of Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that
   knowledge about artificial intelligence, followed by innovation
   orientation, is the main explanatory variable of GAI use. Among
   sociodemographic variables, Generation X and Z stood out as the most
   relevant. It is also noteworthy that the perceived privacy risk does not
   show a clear inhibitory influence on usage. Factors representing the
   positive consequences of GAI, such as performance expectancy and social
   utility, exert a stronger influence than the negative impact of
   hindering factors such as perceived privacy or social risks.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in neural networks have given rise to generative
   artificial intelligence, systems able to produce fluent responses to
   natural questions or attractive and even photorealistic images from text

   annotating and manipulating images and extracting salience. This
   architecture will be important for applications like automated x-ray
   interpretation or real-time highlighting of anatomy in ultrasound
   images. Second, this article examines the transformer architecture in
   the interpretation and generation of natural language, as it will be
   useful in producing automated summarization of medical records or
   performing initial patient screening. The author also applies the
   GPT-3.5 algorithm to example questions from the American Board of

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a pivotal
   focus in global innovation agendas, revealing transformative potential
   that extends beyond technological applications to reshape diverse
   societal domains. Given the fundamental dependency of GenAI deployment
   on circuits and systems (CAS), a co-evolutionary approach integrating
   both technological paradigms becomes imperative. This synergistic
   framework confronts three interrelated challenges: 1) developing
   deployment-ready GenAI algorithms, 2) engineering
   implementation-efficient CAS architectures, and 3) leveraging GenAI for
   autonomous CAS designs - each representing critical innovations vectors.
   Given the rapid advancement of GenAI-CAS technologies, a comprehensive
   synthesis has become an urgent priority across academia and industry.
   Consequently, this timely review systematically analyzes current
   advancements, provides integrative perspectives, and identifies emerging
   research trajectories. This review endeavors to serve both AI and CAS
   communities, thereby catalyzing an innovation feedback loop:
   GenAI-optimized CAS architectures in turn accelerate GenAI evolution

Abstract = {As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) rapidly integrates into
   higher education, a critical question arises: should we focus on the

   structure of these stakeholders and the patterns of relationships
   between them. Utilizing a systematic literature review, we screened 224
   studies and selected 38 key articles to construct a hierarchical
   framework illustrating the complex interactions among stakeholders. The
   research reveals the prominence of educators, students, and
   administrators while reflecting the increasing attention to technology
   vendors and government agencies. Interactions among stakeholders
   primarily fall into four patterns: cooperation, control and guidance,
   support and dependency, as well as competition and conflict. Although
   existing research extensively discusses GAI's potential, this study
   argues that in-depth analyses of stakeholder roles and relationships are
   lacking, particularly given real-world complexities. Future research
   should explore these multidimensional relationships to promote

Abstract = {Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a research
   focus of artificial intelligence. Inspired by two-player zero-sum game,
   GANs comprise a generator and a discriminator, both trained under the
   adversarial learning idea. The goal of GANs is to estimate the potential
   distribution of real data samples and generate new samples from that
   distribution. Since their initiation, GANs have been widely studied due
   to their enormous prospect for applications, including image and vision
   computing, speech and language processing, etc. In this review paper, we
   summarize the state of the art of GANs and look into the future.
   Firstly, we survey GANs' proposal background, theoretic and
   implementation models, and application fields. Then, we discuss GANs'
   advantages and disadvantages, and their development trends. In
   particular, we investigate the relation between GANs and parallel
   intelligence, with the conclusion that GANs have a great potential in
   parallel systems research in terms of virtual-real interaction and
   integration. Clearly, GANs can provide substantial algorithmic support

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the hospitality

   loyalty towards generative AI have not been thoroughly examined despite
   its potential. This study applies a multi-analytic approach, which

   investigate the relationships among the risk variables, such as the
   cognitive and emotional responses in regards to shaping loyalty. We
   examine the impact of performance, financial, time, psychological, and

   variables by utilising the cognitive-emotional-behavioural framework. We
   also explore the moderating role of customer innovativeness and employ a
   fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) in order to uncover
   causal recipes for loyalty. The findings reveal that cognitive and
   emotional variables, such as perceived behavioural control and emotional
   well-being are important and necessary conditions for customer loyalty
   to manifest, and customer innovativeness has an interaction effect on
   these relationships. This study offers valuable insights for academia
   and practitioners in regards to leveraging generative AI technologies in

Abstract = {As urbanization accelerates, aging infrastructure demands more advanced
   inspection methods for structural health monitoring. The growing
   integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision
   technologies has significantly enhanced damage detection accuracy while
   simultaneously reducing inspection time and operational costs. Despite
   these advantages, the adoption of AI-based technologies in
   infrastructure maintenance remains limited due to challenges related to
   data. One major issue is the lack of comprehensive, task-specific
   annotated datasets. Another is the poor quality of images captured by
   drones or mobile devices, which are often affected by noise, blurring,
   and inconsistent lighting. Although recent advances in generative AI
   offer promising support for structural health monitoring, it remains
   unclear which models are best suited for specific tasks. This study
   examines the use of generative AI in structural health monitoring,
   focusing on key challenges such as limited datasets and low-quality
   image restoration. The review covers a range of generative AI
   technologies, outlining their principles, strengths, limitations, and
   representative applications to support the selection of appropriate
   tools for specific tasks. Generative AI models enable accurate image
   segmentation and structural anomaly detection using limited training
   data. The paper also explores new opportunities for integrating
   multimodal generative AI to enhance human-computer interaction in
   support of structural health monitoring. A framework is proposed to
   streamline the use of generative AI technologies for data augmentation,
   image restoration, damage inspection, and human-computer interaction in

Abstract = {In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable
   advancements, stretching the limits of what is possible and opening up
   new frontiers. This comparative review investigates the evolving
   landscape of AI advancements, providing a thorough exploration of
   innovative techniques that have shaped the field. Beginning with the
   fundamentals of AI, including traditional machine learning and the
   transition to data-driven approaches, the narrative progresses through
   core AI techniques such as reinforcement learning, generative
   adversarial networks, transfer learning, and neuroevolution. The
   significance of explainable AI (XAI) is emphasized in this review, which
   also explores the intersection of quantum computing and AI. The review
   delves into the potential transformative effects of quantum technologies
   on AI advancements and highlights the challenges associated with their
   integration. Ethical considerations in AI, including discussions on
   bias, fairness, transparency, and regulatory frameworks, are also
   addressed. This review aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of
   the rapidly evolving field of AI. Reinforcement learning, generative
   adversarial networks, and transfer learning lead AI research, with a
   growing emphasis on transparency. Neuroevolution and quantum AI, though
   less studied, show potential for future developments.},

Abstract = {A leading critic of the disruptive force of technology in education,
   Bernard Stiegler saw the counter-effects of artificial intelligence in
   undermining human agency, autonomy and individuality, rendering the role
   of education ever more critical. Stiegler believes that our goal is not
   to abandon technology but to focus our attention on its power and
   direction in a hypercapitalist economy. While he did not foresee the
   emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), its rapid
   acceleration raises important issues for his notion of digital writing
   as a pharmakon. In this essay, we examine Stiegler's view on
   intelligence, digital writing, technological memory, and neuropower,
   focusing specifically on his Shanghai lecture and Nanjing Lectures. We
   compare Stiegler with Catherine Malabou, who examines the nature of
   intelligence primarily through the lens of neuroscience. We argue that
   Malabou's view of neuroplasticity in human and artificial brains, and
   her critique of techno-narcissism in the control over technology, add an
   important dimension to Stiegler's political critique of education.
   Finally, we examine how best to construe AI as part of a
   hyper-materialist epistemology that Stiegler espouses in the conclusion
   of his Nanjing Lectures, to bring about neganthropic knowledge through a
   therapeutics of care.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study investigates how entrepreneurship education influences
   e-entrepreneurial intention through e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy,
   with generative artificial intelligence incorporation as a moderating
   factor. The study uses the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework to
   comprehensively understand the relationship between educational,
   psychological and technological factors in fostering e-entrepreneurship
   among university students.Design/methodology/approachA quantitative
   study was conducted using survey data collected from 504 university
   students in Vietnam. The PROCESS macro was employed to test the
   mediating role of e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy and the moderating
   effect of generative artificial intelligence incorporation on the
   relationships among entrepreneurship education, e-entrepreneurial
   self-efficacy and intention.FindingsThe results demonstrate that
   entrepreneurship education significantly influences both
   e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy and intention. E-entrepreneurial
   self-efficacy mediates the relationship between entrepreneurship
   education and intention. Generative artificial intelligence
   incorporation amplifies the effects of entrepreneurship education and
   e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy on intention, both directly and
   indirectly, highlighting its role as a transformative driver in
   e-entrepreneurship.Practical implicationsThe findings suggest that
   integrating generative artificial intelligence tools and
   entrepreneurship-focused education into training programs can enhance
   students' digital entrepreneurial skills. Policymakers and educators
   should develop strategies to foster digital literacy and entrepreneurial
   competence to prepare students for technology-driven business
   environments.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature
   by extending the stimulus-organism-response framework to
   e-entrepreneurship. It uniquely integrates educational, psychological
   and technological factors, offering new insights into the mechanisms
   that foster e-entrepreneurial intention in emerging markets.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {3},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI)
   technologies has ushered in a new era of potential applications across
   various industries. The value of this technology has been increasingly
   recognized, with integration having the potential to revolutionize both
   training and practice. However, there is currently a lack of governance
   policies and best practices with this technology with respect to
   surgical education. We set out to redress this research gap by
   conducting a thematic analysis using Braun's principles of generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) technologies' policies, standards, and
   governance frameworks across multiple industries.MethodsThe methodology
   involved a thorough examination of policies, guidelines, and
   communications from nine selected industries, including insurance,
   finance, sports, legal, government, academic, airlines, pharmaceutical,
   and automotive sectors. Three experts with diverse industry backgrounds
   and with shared backgrounds in surgical education, conducted
   line-by-line coding of 42 documents, using both deductive and inductive
   approaches. This process identified key themes related to the uses,
   risks, and mitigants of generative AI.ResultsThe results revealed four
   primary risk categories: privacy, inaccuracy, equity, and intellectual
   property. Additionally, four risk mitigant categories emerged:
   regulation and monitoring, application of existing policies,
   accountability, and transparency. This qualitative summary provides a
   foundational framework to understand the landscape of generative AI best
   practices and guidelines in the context of surgical
   education.ConclusionsWe outline a framework to guide ethical
   consideration when integrating generative AI into surgical education.
   Use cases demonstrate how the framework may be used by decision-makers
   across 4 surgical education applications. The results of this study
   provide a preliminary basis of cross-industrial themes to guide best
   practices and governance standards for integration of generative AI into
   surgical education.},

Abstract = {This review focuses on the transformative applications of deep learning
   and artificial intelligence in textile dyeing, printing, and finishing.
   In textile dyeing, the topics span color prediction, color-based
   classification, dyeing recipe prediction, dyeing pattern recognition,
   and the nuanced domain of color fabric defect detection. In textile
   printing, applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning
   center around pattern detection in printed fabrics, the generation of
   novel patterns, and the critical task of detecting defects in printed
   textiles. In textile finishing the prediction of fabric thermosetting
   parameters is discussed. Artificial neural networks, diverse
   convolutional neural network variations like AlexNet, traditional
   machine learning approaches including support vector regression,
   principal component analysis, XGBoost, and generative artificial
   intelligence such as generative adversarial networks, as well as genetic
   algorithms all find application in this multifaceted exploration. At its
   core, the interest to use these methodologies is because of the need to
   minimize repetitive and time-consuming manual tasks, curtail prototyping
   costs, and promote process automation. The review unravels a plethora of
   innovative architectures and frameworks, each tailored to address
   specific challenges. However, a persistent hurdle looms - the scarcity
   of data, which remains a significant impediment. While unveiling a
   collection of research findings, the review also spotlights the inherent
   challenges in implementing artificial intelligence solutions in the
   textile dyeing and printing domain.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative technologies, and
   large language models are transforming modern education. On the one
   hand, these tools can automate certain aspects of teaching, personalize
   educational materials, and improve learning efficiency. However,
   concerns are emerging regarding the impact of AI on the quality of
   education, the mental health of students, and fundamental academic
   values. This article reviews the scientific literature on the
   applications of artificial intelligence in education, with a special
   emphasis on its impact on student mental health. Based on an analysis of
   120 scientific articles, the study automatically extracted data on AI
   implementation's potential opportunities and threats. A novel aspect of
   this work is identifying factors that can be considered both
   opportunities and threats depending on context. In addition, a frequency
   analysis of keywords and phrases uncovered many opportunities and
   challenges. All identified aspects are characterized in the article. The
   article also highlights key barriers to using large language models
   (LLMs) for detecting student mental health issues, such as
   underestimating suicide risk, difficulties with interpreting subtle
   language, biases in training data, lack of cultural sensitivity, and
   unresolved ethical concerns. These challenges illustrate why generative
   AI is not yet reliable for supporting student mental health, especially
   in high-risk situations. One of the key conclusions is that the use of
   generative AI to support student mental health is seldom addressed in

Title = {Generative artificial intelligence in creative contexts: a systematic
   review and future research agenda},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT REVIEW QUARTERLY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAR 14},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has recently attracted
   attention from literature and organisations, especially due to advances
   in machine learning techniques. However, research on GenAI in creative
   contexts remains in its early stages, with few attempts made to assess
   the current body of research or synthesise the existing knowledge in
   this area. To address this gap, this paper employs a systematic
   literature review of 64 studies to identify methods, research trends and
   key thematic insights shaping the current understanding of GenAI in
   creative contexts. The findings of this systematic literature review
   emphasise the rapid development of research on GenAI in creative
   contexts. The analysis highlights key factors influencing the adoption
   and impact of GenAI in creative processes, as well as the implications
   for creative outcomes and industry practices. From this analysis,
   several potential directions for future research emerge, including the
   long-term effects of GenAI on creative processes, socio-economic
   implications for creative industries, and frameworks for ethical use,
   and perception of GenAI-generated content.},

   Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {ARAB WORLD ENGLISH JOURNAL},
Year = {2025},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {330-347},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly
   generative AI tools like ChatGPT, have transformed language education,
   fostering opportunities and challenges in English as a Second Language
   (ESL) learning. The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and
   incredibly generative AI tools like ChatGPT in language education have
   widely affected the landscape of ESL students' teaching and learning
   experiences. Despite the advancement of AI technology, limited research
   has been conducted on the impact of AI on a more profound cognitive
   impact, particularly on students' ability to think critically and
   independently. This scoping review examines how AI influences ESL
   learners' critical thinking and writing skills. Using the Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
   framework, this study synthesizes findings from 15 peer-reviewed
   articles published between 2023 and 2025 to answer the research
   questions: How does AI affect critical thinking development? Moreover,
   2) What are the ethical concerns resulting from AI-assisted learning?
   This study conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to discover
   in-depth insights on the over-reliance on generative AI techniques and
   the development of critical thinking skills in the context of ESL
   writing to contribute to the existing literature. Results indicate that
   while AI significantly enhances writing quality and critical thinking
   skills, excessive reliance on AI tools may hinder independent learning.
   The study calls for AI literacy programs to ensure AI's effective and
   ethical integration into ESL education.},

   GenAI in clinical exercise physiology are described, in addition to
   recommendations for future research to address gaps in knowledge. Future
   directions, including the roles and responsibilities of specific
   stakeholder groups are discussed, highlighting the need for clear
   professional guidelines in facilitating safe and ethical deployment of
   GenAI into clinical exercise physiology practice. Synthesis of current
   literature serves as an essential step in guiding strategies to ensure
   the safe, ethical, and effective integration of GenAI in clinical
   exercise physiology, providing a foundation for future guidelines,

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper explores the potential integration of generative AI (e.g.,
   large language models) with neuroscientific and physiological approaches
   in psychiatric practice. Renowned for its advanced natural language
   processing capabilities, generative AI has shown promise in
   psychological counseling, emotional support, and clinical interventions.
   However, its application alongside neuroscience and physiology in
   psychiatry remains underexplored. We propose that generative AI can
   facilitate translations and adaptive explanations, streamline
   experimental preparation, enhance multi-modal data analysis, and improve
   clinical applications through realtime communication, content
   generation, and data synthesis. Furthermore, we examine how generative
   AI, as a specialized application of deep learning, can identify new
   biomarkers and construct neurophysiological models of psychiatric
   symptoms. We also discuss the synergistic relationship between
   neuroscience and AI development, particularly in improving AI's
   emotional recognition and learning mechanisms. While acknowledging the
   potential benefits, we address the challenges and risks associated with
   generative AI in psychiatry, including data reliability, privacy
   concerns, and resource constraints. This perspective advocates for a
   balanced approach to leveraging AI's capabilities while safeguarding
   mental health.},

Title = {Using Machine Learning and Generative Intelligence in Book Cover
   Development},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF IMAGING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence
   approaches is finding ever wider application in various areas of life.
   This paper considers the problem of improving editorial and publishing
   processes, namely self-publishing, when designing book covers using
   machine learning and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) methods.
   When choosing a book, readers often have certain expectations regarding
   the design of the publication, including the color of the cover. These
   expectations can be called color preferences, and they can depend on the
   genre of the book, its target audience, and even personal associations.
   Cultural context can also influence color choice, as certain colors can
   symbolize different emotions or moods in different cultures. Cluster
   analysis of book cover images of the same genre allows us to identify
   color preferences inherent in the genre, which is proposed to be used
   when designing new covers. The capabilities of generative services for
   creating and improving cover designs are also investigated. An improved
   flow chart for using GAI in creating book covers in the process of
   self-publishing is proposed, which includes new stages, namely
   exploring, conditioning, and evolving. At these stages, the designer
   creates prompts for GAI and examines how they and GAI's issuances
   correspond to the task. Conditioning allows for even more precise
   adjustment of prompts to features of each book, and the evolving stage
   also includes post-processing of results already received from GAI.
   Post-processing, in turn, can be performed both in generative services
   and by a designer. The experiment allowed us to use the machine-learning
   method to determine which colors are most often found in book cover
   layouts of one of the genres and to check whether these colors
   correspond to harmonious color palettes. In accordance with the proposed
   scheme of the design process using generative artificial intelligence,
   versions of book cover layouts of a given genre were obtained.},

   include the technological environment, as an external factor, and
   innovation, as an internal factor. Methods: This study reviews the
   existing literature on implementing GAI in business decision-making. It
   assesses its short-, medium- and long-term effects, considering the
   interaction between GAI and human judgment. Challenges related to
   uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity are examined, and the relevant

   Results: The review shows that, despite the advanced capabilities of GAI
   to analyze data and generate patterns, human judgment remains crucial in
   situations of high uncertainty. The results suggest that combining GAI
   with human expertise can improve the accuracy and efficiency of
   strategic decision-making by integrating the strengths of both parties.
   Conclusions: The implementation of GAI can offer significant

Abstract = {Crystal structure prediction (CSP) represents a fundamental research
   frontier in computational materials science and chemistry, aiming to
   predict thermodynamically stable periodic structures from given chemical
   compositions. Traditional methods often face challenges such as high
   computational costs and local minima trapping. Recently, artificial
   intelligence methods, represented by generative adversarial networks
   (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), diffusion models, and large
   language models (LLMs), have revolutionized the traditional prediction
   paradigm. These computational frameworks efficiently extract chemical
   rules and structural features from crystal databases, significantly
   reducing computational costs while maintaining prediction accuracy. This
   Perspective systematically evaluates the advantages and limitations of
   various generative models, explores their synergies with conventional
   approaches, and discusses their future prospects in accelerating
   materials discovery and development, providing new insights for future
   research directions.},

Abstract = {The novel generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed by OpenAI,
   i.e., ChatGPT, rised a great interest in both scientific and business
   contexts. This new wave of technological advancement typically produces
   deep transformation in the workplace, requiring new skills. However,
   none of the studies in literature provide quantitative analysis and

   we collected a database of 616,073 tweets about ChatGPT, and used
   Natural Language Processing techniques to identify the tasks users
   requested ChatGPT to perform, and the sentiment related to these tasks.
   Then, we compared these tasks with a standard taxonomy of skills (i.e.,
   ESCO) using BERT. The results of the study underline that ChatGPT
   impacts 185 different skills. Moreover, we proposed a model to represent
   the interaction of the user and ChatGPT, useful to define four skills
   which are emerging for using this new technology.},

   RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {103},
Number = {5},
Pages = {188-206},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly
   prevalent across various fields, particularly in psychology, where it
   has the potential to significantly transform approaches to diagnosis,
   therapy, and research. This paper summarizes current research on the use
   of generative AI in psychology and its impact on the theory and practice
   of psychological science. One of the primary applications of generative
   AI is in psychodiagnostics, where it can be used to automate the
   creation of diagnostic tools and interpret test results, analyze large
   volumes of data, and provide more accurate diagnostic conclusions. This
   significantly reduces the workload on psychologists while simultaneously
   increasing the efficiency of diagnostic processes. In the field of
   psychotherapy, generative AI can be used to create individualized
   therapeutic programs that provide continuous support to users, which is
   particularly important when access to qualified specialists is limited.
   Another important aspect is the use of generative AI in psychological
   research: AI can help in creating behavior models, predicting mental
   disorders, developing new research methodologies, reducing routine
   administrative burdens, and more. While generative AI revolutionizes the
   work of psychologists, it simultaneously creates complex issues related
   to ethics, confidentiality, accuracy of diagnostic and therapeutic
   methods, and more. To ensure that generative AI is effective and
   ethical, clear standards and regulatory frameworks must be developed for
   its use. Therefore, the authors propose recommendations for the
   implementation of AI in psychological practice, emphasizing the need to
   develop specific guidelines to address these issues. The role of
   psychologists in ensuring the ethical use of AI, the necessity of
   continuous monitoring, and the assessment of its impact on users are
   also discussed. Overall, generative AI holds great potential for
   psychological research and practice, but its implementation requires
   careful planning and consideration of ethical aspects to ensure safety
   and effectiveness.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping consumer
   interactions by offering personalized guidance that ranges from broad
   suggestions to narrow recommendations. Yet, little is known about how
   these interactions influence decision-making and consumer empowerment.
   This research investigates how distinct types of GenAI nudges (narrow
   vs. broad) shape goal desirability and, in turn, consumer empowerment.
   Drawing upon Construal Level Theory (CLT), Goal Pursuit Theory, and
   Nudging Theory, we examine whether narrow (vs. broad) GenAI nudges
   enhance consumers' sense of empowerment by increasing goal desirability.
   Three mixed-method studies (one qualitative and two experimental) reveal
   that narrow GenAI nudges significantly heighten goal desirability,
   leading to greater consumer empowerment and key behavioral outcomes,
   including satisfaction, repurchase intentions, and advocacy (net
   promoter score). These findings advance theoretical perspectives on
   GenAI as a nudge for consumer decision-making and offer practical
   insights for designing AI systems that effectively guide consumer
   decisions within structured choice architectures.},

Abstract = {Background Ambient artificial intelligence scribes have become
   widespread commercial products in the era of generative artificial
   intelligence. While studies have examined the effect of these tools on
   the experience of attending physicians, little evidence is available
   regarding their use by resident physician trainees. Objectives To assess
   trainee experience with an ambient artificial intelligence scribe using
   measures of usability, acceptability, and documentation burden. Methods
   This prospective observational study enrolled 47 trainees in a 2-month
   pilot. Pre/postsurveys were conducted with the NASA Task Load Index
   (NASA-TLX, raw unweighted form, pre/post, for cognitive load during the
   documentation), the System Usability Scale (post; general usability),
   the Net Promoter Score (post; acceptability), and the AMIA TrendBurden
   Survey (pre/post; documentation burden). Electronic health record
   utilization metrics were obtained from Epic Signal for both the pilot
   period and a 6-month baseline. Results In total, 43/47 (91.5\%) of
   participants adopted the intervention in practice. NASA-TLX scores
   improved from 56.3 to 43.3 (p < 0.001), and multiple items on the
   TrendBurden survey improved with high measures of acceptability. No
   significant difference in time spent on notes activity per note written
   was observed, with a median increase of 0.4 minutes ( p = 0.568).
   Conclusion Trainee use of an ambient artificial intelligence scribe was
   associated with improvements in documentation burden. Additional
   research on the effect of this technology on trainee learning and
   expertise development is needed.},

Abstract = {Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in chemistry, more
   or less covertly, for many decades (databases for data management,
   programs for designing synthesis, toxicological expert systems, etc.),
   the massive emergence of user-friendly artificial intelligence presents
   an interesting opportunity and challenge for chemists to improve the
   communication power of chemistry and its position in society. Although
   repeatedly questioned by many critics per se value-neutral generative AI
   stands a good chance of becoming an important tool for presenting
   chemical information throughout all strata of society. Additionally, it
   can support the spread of science-based opinions on chemistry to the
   public and help popularize science in general as well. AI allows
   virtually every scientist to become a major player in science
   communication. This could lead to a containment of chemophobia. However,
   the use of AI as a communication tool requires continuous education,
   personal development and training of those who use it, in this case
   chemists and scientists in general. They will play a crucial role as
   arbiters of the appropriateness, adequacy and factual accuracy of the
   content generated by generative AI. The democratization of communication
   made possible by generative AI entails the need to adapt the dialogue to
   the communication preferences, demography and education of the
   interlocutors. Thus, generative AI empowers both those who enter the
   prompts and those who receive the subsequent results. Most scientists do
   not realize it, but generative AI puts the public, not scientists, at
   the center of communication. It is important to recognize this and use
   generative AI to target communication, education, and overall community
   development. The clash of narratives that may be a natural consequence
   of the growing number of generative AI users and the increasing amount
   of content being created may, perhaps unexpectedly for many, lead to the
   opposite result - a new Enlightenment. Either way, chemists would do
   well to be there; for their ability to understand the laws of matter,
   the beginning and end of things; for the dual nature of chemistry as an

Abstract = {Recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, specifically
   regarding deep learning methods, have invigorated research into novel
   ways for the exploration of chemical space. Compared to more traditional
   methods that rely on chemical fragments and combinatorial recombination
   deep generative models generate molecules in a non-transparent way that
   defies easy rationalization. However, this opaque nature also promises
   to explore uncharted chemical space in novel ways that do not rely on
   structural similarity directly. These aspects and the complexity of
   training such models makes model assessment regarding novelty,
   uniqueness, and distribution of generated molecules a central aspect.
   This perspective gives an overview of current methodologies for chemical
   space exploration with an emphasis on deep neural network approaches.
   Key aspects of generative models include choice of molecular
   representation, the targeted chemical space, and the methodology for

   of Smart Action Learning (SAL) and generative AI tools in the
   ``Functional Clothing and Materials{''} course to enhance student
   engagement, problem-solving abilities, and practical skill acquisition.
   SAL, a student-centered learning approach, incorporates blended
   learning, flipped learning, and problem-based learning (PBL)
   methodologies to foster self-directed and cooperative learning. The
   study was conducted over an eight-week period with second-year students
   in an apparel major, integrating AI-based problem-solving techniques
   into coursework. The course design included a five-stage instructional
   framework: instructor-led lectures, problem identification, AI-assisted
   research, collaborative solution development, and final presentations.
   The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated through surveys
   measuring self-directed learning ability, cooperative learning ability,
   problem-solving ability, and academic achievement. Results indicate that
   students demonstrated high levels of engagement, improved
   problem-solving abilities, and increased learning satisfaction through

   disciplines within the domains of human science and technology. This
   study aims to explore the effects of generative AI-assisted preservice

   implemented for an experimental group (teaching skills training by
   generative AI) and a control group (teaching skills training by
   traditional methods) by investigating the teacher self-efficacy and
   higher order thinking of the two groups before and after the experiment.
   Finally, a semistructured interview comprising open-ended questions was
   administered to 25 preservice teachers within the experimental group to
   present their views on generative AI-assisted teaching. The results
   showed that the scores of preservice teachers in the experimental group,

Abstract = {Background Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools may soon be
   integrated into health care practice and research. Nurses in leadership
   roles, many of whom are doctorally prepared, will need to determine
   whether and how to integrate them in a safe and useful way. Objective
   This study aimed to develop and evaluate a brief intervention to
   increase PhD nursing students' knowledge of appropriate applications for
   using generative AI tools in health care. Methods We created didactic
   lectures and laboratory-based activities to introduce generative AI to
   students enrolled in a nursing PhD data science and visualization
   course. Students were provided with a subscription to Chat Generative
   Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) 4.0, a general-purpose generative AI
   tool, for use in and outside the class. During the didactic portion, we
   described generative AI and its current and potential future
   applications in health care, including examples of appropriate and
   inappropriate applications. In the laboratory sessions, students were
   given three tasks representing different use cases of generative AI in
   health care practice and research (clinical decision support, patient
   decision support, and scientific communication) and asked to engage with
   ChatGPT on each. Students ( n = 10) independently wrote a brief
   reflection for each task evaluating safety (accuracy, hallucinations)
   and usability (ease of use, usefulness, and intention to use in the
   future). Reflections were analyzed using directed content analysis.
   Results Students were able to identify the strengths and limitations of
   ChatGPT in completing all three tasks and developed opinions on whether
   they would feel comfortable using ChatGPT for similar tasks in the
   future. All of them reported increasing their self-rated competency in
   generative AI by one to two points on a five-point rating scale.
   Conclusion This brief educational intervention supported doctoral
   nursing students in understanding the appropriate uses of ChatGPT, which
   may support their ability to appraise and use these tools in their
   future work.},

   program was significantly higher than that of ChatGPT (P = 0.009,
   Pearson's Chi-square test).CONCLUSION: Although the currently released
   artificial intelligence chatbots can be used to access accurate
   information about lenses, cataracts, and refractive surgery, one should
   always be careful about the accuracy of the answers given.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing various industries, with
   healthcare being one of the most impacted sectors. This article explores
   the fundamentals of AI, with a specific focus on machine learning, deep
   learning, and generative AI. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables
   systems to identify patterns in large data sets, improving over time
   without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a more advanced
   subfield, uses multi-layered neural networks to process complex
   information. The advent of generative AI, such as GPT and GANs, has
   expanded the potential of AI to create new content autonomously,
   transforming areas like drug discovery and personalized medicine. The
   article also addresses the ethical considerations surrounding the use of
   AI, particularly concerning data privacy, algorithmic bias, and
   equitable access to AI-driven technologies. These considerations are
   essential for ensuring the responsible development and implementation of
   AI in healthcare. (c) 2025 SESPM. Published by Elsevier Espa \&

   tools to qualitative data analysis. From promises of automated coding
   and thematic analysis to functioning as a virtual research assistant
   that supports researchers in diverse interpretive and analytical tasks,
   the potential applications of GenAI in qualitative research appear vast.
   In this paper, we take a step back and ask what sort of technological
   artifact is GenAI and evaluate whether it is appropriate for qualitative
   data analysis. We provide an accessible, technologically informed
   analysis of GenAI, specifically large language models (LLMs), and put to
   the test the claimed transformative potential of using GenAI in
   qualitative data analysis. Our evaluation illustrates significant
   shortcomings that, if the technology is adopted uncritically by
   management researchers, will introduce unacceptable epistemic risks. We
   explore these epistemic risks and emphasize that the essence of
   qualitative data analysis lies in the interpretation of meaning, an
   inherently human capability.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the influence of Generative Artificial
   Intelligence (GenAI) on consumer adoption of retail chatbots, focusing
   on how GenAI impacts key adoption determinants, the role of familiarity
   and assessing its effects across different stages of the customer
   journey. We conducted two waves of surveys, one pre- and one post-GenAI
   integration, to compare consumer perceptions across three customer
   service tasks. Using the Service Robot Acceptance Model (SRAM) as a
   framework, we found that GenAI enhances consumer perceptions of chatbot
   usefulness, human-likeness, and familiarity, thereby increasing adoption
   intentions. However, trust remains largely unchanged, and privacy
   concerns have risen post-GenAI. Additionally, the relationships remain
   stable across customer journey stages, with familiarity playing a key
   role. Our findings extend SRAM to the retail context with GenAI,
   offering new insights into the temporal stability of chatbot adoption
   factors. It underscores familiarity's dual role (direct and indirect) in
   fostering adoption, while highlighting that GenAI impacts specific

Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Background Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) has
   revolutionized the healthcare system for medical students and their
   educational process worldwide. Several studies assessed its efficacy in
   improving medical studies learning, and others assessed medical
   students' knowledge and attitudes about generative AI. So, we aim to
   determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of generative AI among
   medical students in Egypt. Methods In 2024, a cross-sectional study
   using a semi-structured questionnaire was performed, targeting 423
   students as a convenient sample from 10 selected Egyptian universities
   by simple random sampling. The questionnaire was distributed via online
   platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, X, Telegram, and Messenger. Data
   about sociodemographic characteristics, students' general knowledge
   about generative AI and its limitations, and their attitudes and
   practices, respectively, were collected. Results About
   2\textbackslash{}3 (61.5\%) of the studied students had satisfactory
   knowledge about generative AI and (44.7\%) had a positive attitude.
   Males demonstrated significantly higher knowledge than females (69.3\%
   vs. 55\%, P-value = 0.003). Knowledge level also differs significantly
   by university (P-value < 0.001), with Suez-Canal and 6th October
   university students achieving the highest satisfactory scores. Key
   significant predictors that affect knowledge level include gender,
   university and study phase according to binary logistic regression
   results. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between
   satisfactory knowledge and Practice level (r = 0.303, P < 0.001).
   Finally, most students use generative AI to check Grammar and prepare
   their homework or assignments. Conclusion and recommendations There is
   moderate knowledge and positive attitude about AI that were reflected in
   medical students' practice. However, knowledge about AI influenced by
   gender, university and study phase. Importantly, better knowledge
   significantly correlates with greater generative AI practice. Offering
   specialized courses or faculty modules about AI enhance awareness among
   Egyptian medical students. Such initiatives will enable them to gain
   knowledge and apply it effectively and wisely.},

Abstract = {Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence raise
   fundamental questions about its impact on the journalistic profession
   and the future role of journalists in news production. However, the
   attitudes of regular journalists towards artificial intelligence remain
   largely unexplored. We address this gap by investigating the potentials
   and concerns that Danish journalists attribute to the impact of
   artificial intelligence on journalism. Journalists largely acknowledge
   its potential to streamline news production. While they also express
   broader concerns about the trustworthiness of journalism and the risk of
   job displacement, their more immediate worry lies in the impact of
   artificial intelligence on job meaningfulness and professional identity.
   These findings reveal a differentiated perspective on the
   profession-wide and individual impacts of artificial intelligence on
   journalism. Furthermore, journalists emphasise their human qualities and
   skills such as nuanced judgement, empathy, and creativity as beyond
   artificial intelligence's capabilities. This indicates that artificial
   intelligence prompts journalists to reshape their expertise to
   prioritise the human touch in journalism, suggesting a broadened view of
   the journalistic profession. By examining these perceptions among
   regular journalists, this study contributes to a better understanding of
   the multifaceted challenges that artificial intelligence poses to both
   individual journalistic practices and the broader profession.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper, we undertake a critical analysis of how chatbots built on
   generative artificial intelligence impact assumptions underlying
   definitions of trust. We engage a particular definition of trust and the
   object-oriented model of trust that was built upon it and identify how
   at least four implicit assumptions may no longer hold. Those assumptions
   include that people generally provide others with a default level of
   trust, the ability to identify whether the trusted agent is human or
   artificial, that risk and trust can be readily quantified or
   categorized, and that there is no expectation of gain by agents engaged
   in trust relationships. Based on that analysis, we suggest modifications
   to the definition and model to accommodate the features of generative AI
   chatbots. Our changes re-emphasize developers' responsibility for the
   impacts of their AI artifacts, no matter how sophisticated the artifact
   may be. The changes also reflect that trust relationships are more
   fraught when participants in such relationships are not confident in
   identifying the nature of a potential trust partner.},

Abstract = {The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in
   academic settings has the potential to revolutionize learning
   experiences, enhance educational outcomes, and streamline academic
   processes. The aim of this research was to explore the perceptions of
   Lebanese health sciences students regarding the use of generative AI in
   higher education. A qualitative descriptive research design informed by
   descriptive phenomenology was employed. Semi-structured interviews were
   carried out among 23 health sciences students at one major private
   university in Beirut. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted over the
   period of 3 months. The inductive thematic analysis generated two
   themes, and eight subthemes highlighting the benefits and concerns in
   using AI; customized, self-paced, and autonomous learning, improved
   language and writing skills, development of innovative concepts,
   enhanced efficiency, accuracy of information, overreliance on AI,
   equitable access, unclear policies. Results from this study emphasized
   the importance of combined efforts across sectors to close access gaps,
   encourage inclusiveness, and develop well framed policies that enable
   students to utilize these new technologies for their maximum benefits.},

Title = {Effect of generative artificial intelligence on academic publishing
   ethics: The role of user agreements},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE},

Month = {2025 AUG 21},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT are rapidly
   expanding in scientific research and publication due to their excellent
   language understanding, generation and knowledge reasoning capabilities,
   but the accompanying ethical issues of publication cannot be ignored.
   User agreements can provide behavioural guidance for users to use
   generative AI tools, but its ethical guiding role in academic publishing
   is unclear. This study aims to investigate the ethical implications of
   generative AI in academic publishing, with a specific focus on the role
   of user agreements. We selected 98 large language models (LLMs) which
   were divided into 23 series, and analysed their user agreements and
   privacy policy content to explore their ethical guiding role in academic
   publishing. The survey study found that LLMs user agreements had
   relevant provisions on intellectual property, data privacy and security,
   quality and integrity, and so on, but there were still controversial and
   needed to be further improved contents, such as the ownership of LLMs
   output, and continuous supervision and update of user agreements. The
   publishing community should collaborate closely with academics,
   technical developers, and legal experts to promote the formation of an
   ethical framework for the application of generative AI technology in
   academic publishing. This study systematically analyses the guidance of
   user agreements for LLMs in academic publishing ethics, filling a gap in
   the literature on ethical norms in the field of academic publishing for
   generative AI.},

Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a promising
   technology that can create original content, such as text, images, and
   sound. The use of GenAI in educational settings is becoming increasingly
   popular and offers a range of opportunities and challenges. This special
   issue explores the management and integration of GenAI in educational
   settings, including the ethical considerations, best practices, and
   opportunities. The potential of GenAI in education is vast. By using
   algorithms and data, GenAI can create original content that can be used
   to augment traditional teaching methods, creating a more interactive and
   personalized learning experience. In addition, GenAI can be utilized as
   an assessment tool and for providing feedback to students using
   generated content. For instance, it can be used to create custom
   quizzes, generate essay prompts, or even grade essays. The use of GenAI
   as an assessment tool can reduce the workload of teachers and help
   students receive prompt feedback on their work. Incorporating GenAI in
   educational settings also poses challenges related to academic
   integrity. With availability of GenAI models, students can use them to
   study or complete their homework assignments, which can raise concerns
   about the authenticity and authorship of the delivered work. Therefore,
   it is important to ensure that academic standards are maintained, and
   the originality of the student's work is preserved. This issue
   highlights the need for implementing ethical practices in the use of
   GenAI models and ensuring that the technology is used to support and not
   replace the student's learning experience.},

   Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {8},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {New developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are
   increasingly finding their way into industrial areas such as additive
   manufacturing (AM). Generative AI (GAI) applications in particular offer
   interesting possibilities here, for example, to generate texts, images
   or computer codes with the help of algorithms and to integrate these as
   useful supports in various AM processes. This paper examines the
   opportunities that GAI offers specifically for additive manufacturing.
   There are currently relatively few publications that deal with the topic
   of GAI in AM. Much of the information has only been published in
   preprints. There, the focus has been on algorithms for Natural Language
   Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative
   adversarial networks (GANs). This summarised presentation of the state
   of the art of GAI in AM is new and the link to specific use cases is
   this first comprehensive case study on GAI in AM processes. Building on
   this, three specific use cases are then developed in which generative AI
   tools are used to optimise AM processes. Finally, a Strengths,
   Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis is carried out on
   the general possibilities of GAI, which forms the basis for an in-depth
   discussion on the sensible use of GAI tools in AM. The key findings of
   this work are that GAI can be integrated into AM processes as a useful
   support, making these processes faster and more creative, as well as to
   make the process information digitally recordable and usable. This
   current and future potential, as well as the technical implementation of
   GAI into AM, is also presented and explained visually. It is also shown
   where the use of generative AI tools can be useful and where current or
   future potential risks may arise.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for both text-to-text
   and text-to-image applications have seen rapid and widespread adoption
   in the general and medical communities. While limitations of generative
   AI have been widely reported, there remain valuable applications in

   of both text-to-text and text-to-image generative AI are explored using
   purported applications in medical imaging as case examples. A direct
   comparison of the capabilities of four common text-to-image generative
   AI algorithms is reported and recommendations for the most appropriate
   use, DALL-E 3, justified. The risks use and biases are outlined, and
   appropriate use guidelines framed for use of generative AI in nuclear
   medicine. Generative AI text-to-text and text-to-image generation
   includes inherent biases, particularly gender and ethnicity, that could
   misrepresent nuclear medicine. The assimilation of generative AI tools
   into medical education, image interpretation, patient education, health
   promotion and marketing in nuclear medicine risks propagating errors and

Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},

Month = {SEP 4},
Abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence in education, particularly in
   learning programming, is gaining increasing significance. However,
   research on secondary school students specializing in IT at an early
   stage has received relatively little attention in this field. The aim of
   this study is to assess how vocational secondary school IT students
   utilize Generative artificial intelligence in learning programming. The
   study employed a survey-based methodology, where students with varying
   levels of knowledge were surveyed to understand their AI usage patterns.
   The sample consisted of students from vocational IT schools, and data
   were analyzed using descriptive statistics and independent samples
   t-tests. The results indicate that students with different levels of
   knowledge use AI tools differently, with ChatGPT being the most popular
   tool. The study further highlights that AI usage brings significant
   benefits, such as providing a personalized learning experience and
   enabling quick error correction. However, excessive reliance on AI tools
   may hinder students from acquiring fundamental programming skills. The
   findings support the idea that while AI can effectively complement
   teachers' explanations, overdependence on it can be risky, potentially
   reducing students' creativity and problem-solving abilities. The study
   emphasizes the crucial role of educators in teaching the responsible and
   ethical use of artificial intelligence. The results of this research
   offer new perspectives on the effective integration of Generative
   artificial intelligence into vocational secondary school programming
   education and suggest further studies to compare its applications at the
   university level. However, the study acknowledges certain limitations,
   such as the potential bias of self-reported data, which may affect the
   generalizability of the results. Unlike other studies, the age groups we
   surveyed, and the cohorts formed from them are nearly evenly
   distributed, making our sample representative of the region in question.},

Abstract = {BackgroundGenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promise in
   enhancing personalised learning and improving educational efficiency.
   However, its integration into education raises concerns about
   misinformation and over-reliance, particularly among adolescents.
   Teacher supervision plays a critical role in mitigating these risks and
   ensuring the effective use of Generative AI in classrooms. Despite the
   growing interest in Generative AI, there is limited empirical research
   on its actual impact and the role of teacher oversight.ObjectiveThe
   purpose of this study is to systematically assess the role of Generative
   AI in classroom teaching, with a specific focus on how teacher
   supervision shapes its effectiveness.MethodThis study employed a
   quasi-experimental design to examine differences in learning outcomes
   among students under three instructional methods: traditional
   computer-assisted teaching, Generative AI-assisted teaching without
   teacher supervision and Generative AI-assisted teaching with teacher
   supervision. The study was implemented in the context of a two-week
   Information Science and Technology course in a middle school, involving
   three classes with 45, 41 and 45 students, respectively. To ensure
   consistency in teaching styles, all classes were taught by the same
   experienced teacher. Data collection included a knowledge test to assess
   knowledge mastery, as well as questionnaires to measure learning
   satisfaction and engagement. The collected data were analysed using
   one-way ANOVA to compare the effectiveness of the three teaching
   methods.Results and ConclusionCompared with traditional
   computer-assisted teaching, Generative AI-assisted teaching can
   significantly enhance students' learning satisfaction, but can not
   improve their learning engagement and knowledge mastery level.
   Furthermore, in the process of Generative AI-assisted teaching, teacher
   supervision can significantly increase students' learning engagement and
   knowledge mastery compared with situations without teacher supervision.
   This study indicated Generative AI's potential as an educational tool
   and underscored the essential role of teacher
   supervision.ImplicationsThis study fills a critical gap by providing
   empirical evidence on how Generative AI and teacher supervision interact
   to improve classroom learning outcomes. It shows that Generative AI's
   potential to enhance learning outcomes is significantly amplified with
   teacher oversight.},

   into nephrology education at our institution, highlighting its
   importance and potential applications. It explores how AI can complement
   traditional teaching methods by addressing challenges like information
   overload, diverse learning needs, and continuous learning. Generative AI
   models should be actively utilized under human supervision to ensure
   accuracy when summarizing key teaching points, creating discussion
   topics for journal clubs, and aiding in curriculum development for our
   Nephrology fellowship. Potential future applications include
   simulation-based learning, interactive learning modules, personalized

Title = {Analyzing Higher Education Students' Prompting Techniques and Their
   Impact on ChatGPT's Performance: An Exploratory Study in Spanish},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is reshaping how people interact with
   digital technologies, emphasizing the need to develop effective skills
   for engaging with it. In this context, prompt engineering has emerged as
   a critical skill for optimizing AI-generated outputs. However, research
   on how higher education students interact with these technologies
   remains limited, particularly in non-English-speaking contexts. This
   exploratory study examines how 102 higher education students in Chile
   formulated prompts in Spanish and how their techniques influenced the
   responses generated by ChatGPT (free version 3.5). A quantitative
   analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between prompt
   techniques and response quality. Two emergent prompt engineering
   strategies were identified: the Guide Contextualization Strategy and the
   Specific Purpose Strategy. The Guide Contextualization Strategy focused
   on providing explicit contextual information to guide ChatGPT's
   responses, aligning with few-shot prompting, while the Specific Purpose
   Strategy emphasized defining the request's purpose, aligning with
   structured objective formulation strategies. The regression analysis
   indicated that the Guide Contextualization Strategy had a greater impact
   on response quality, reinforcing the importance of contextual
   information in effective interactions with large language models. As an
   exploratory study, these findings provide preliminary evidence on prompt
   engineering strategies in Spanish, a relatively unexplored area in
   artificial intelligence education research. Based on these results, a
   methodological framework is proposed, encompassing four key dimensions:
   grammatical skills; prompt strategies; response from the large language
   model; and evaluation of response quality. This framework lays the
   groundwork for future artificial intelligence digital literacy
   interventions, fostering critical and effective engagement with
   generative artificial intelligence while also highlighting the need for
   further research to validate and expand these initial insights.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology,
   generative AI has shown broad application prospects and potential in
   various fields. Frequent emergencies have put forward higher
   requirements for traditional Emergency Response Decision Support Systems

   generative AI (ERDSS-GAI), which deeply integrates generative AI with
   three stages of emergency response decision-making. The framework aims
   to leverage the advantages of generative AI in massive data processing,
   knowledge mining, strategy optimization, and other aspects, thereby
   enhancing the intelligence level and emergency response capability of
   ERDSS. The key components and implementation path of ERDSS-GAI are
   systematically explained from a theoretical perspective, and its
   application value is analyzed through the case of rainstorm and flood
   disaster in Shenzhen. This research demonstrates that generative AI can
   improve the scientific and refined level of emergency response
   decision-making, providing a theoretical framework and practical
   insights for its widespread adoption in emergency management.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be broadly described as an
   artificial intelligence system capable of generating images, text, and
   other media types with human prompts. GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E,
   and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia
   equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming,
   fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical
   research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making
   strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed
   study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare.
   Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications,
   real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine
   how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the
   applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient
   treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization,
   mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical
   chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along
   with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that
   employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization,
   medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate
   discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT,
   DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like
   the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient
   data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems,
   and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along
   with several other challenges. We also put forward multiple directions
   for future research in GAI for healthcare.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been part of every citizen's life for
   several years. Still, the emergence of generative AI (GenAI), accessible

   user requests, but are students using these tools ethically and safely?
   Can teachers guide students in this use and use these tools in their
   teaching activities? This paper argues that teacher professional
   development (TPD) is an essential key trigger in adopting these emerging
   technologies. The paper will present an integrative literature review
   that discusses the components of TPD that may empower teachers to guide
   their students towards the ethical and safe use of GenAI. According to
   the literature review, one key component of TPD should be AI literacy,
   which involves understanding AI, its capabilities and limitations, and
   its potential benefits and drawbacks in education. Another essential
   component is hands-on activities that engage teachers, their peers, and
   students in actively using these tools during the training process. The

Title = {The Evaluation of Generative AI Should Include Repetition to Assess
   Stability},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {The increasing interest in the potential applications of generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) models like ChatGPT in health care has
   prompted numerous studies to explore its performance in various medical
   contexts. However, evaluating ChatGPT poses unique challenges due to the
   inherent randomness in its responses. Unlike traditional AI models,
   ChatGPT generates different responses for the same input, making it
   imperative to assess its stability through repetition. This commentary
   highlights the importance of including repetition in the evaluation of
   ChatGPT to ensure the reliability of conclusions drawn from its
   performance. Similar to biological experiments, which often require
   multiple repetitions for validity, we argue that assessing generative AI
   models like ChatGPT demands a similar approach. Failure to acknowledge
   the impact of repetition can lead to biased conclusions and undermine
   the credibility of research findings. We urge researchers to incorporate
   appropriate repetition in their studies from the outset and
   transparently report their methods to enhance the robustness and
   reproducibility of findings in this rapidly evolving field.},

Abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) requires
   innovative educational environments to leverage this technology
   effectively to address concerns like academic integrity, plagiarism, and

   beyond conventional learning approaches and cultivating high-order
   skills and knowledge acquisition. This study employs thing ethnography
   to examine GenAI tools' integration with authentic assessment and

   results reveal insights into creating human-centered and GenAI-enhanced
   learning experiences within a constructive alignment. Specific examples
   are also provided to guide their implementation. Our contributions
   extend beyond the traditional use of GenAI tools as mere agents-to-write

Abstract = {The phrase, ``political theology,{''} has been understood in at least
   three ways: to describe the political implications of various
   theologies, to describe a theology of politics, and to describe the
   theological language that funds modern secular political systems. This
   paper explores the way generative artificial intelligence intersects
   with each of those understandings, especially noting the impact of AI on
   actual physical and corporate bodies. It argues for closer attention to
   the moral concerns that are raised within each understanding and
   advocates for design justice as a way to push the development of AI
   towards supporting systems that promote the flourishing of individual
   and corporate bodies.},

Abstract = {Recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI) in retinal imaging found
   its application in two major categories: discriminative and generative
   AI. For discriminative tasks, conventional convolutional neural networks
   (CNNs) are still major AI techniques. Vision transformers (ViT),
   inspired by the transformer architecture in natural language processing,
   has emerged as useful techniques for discriminating retinal images. ViT
   can attain excellent results when pretrained at sufficient scale and
   transferred to specific tasks with fewer images, compared to
   conventional CNN. Many studies found better performance of ViT, compared
   to CNN, for common tasks such as diabetic retinopathy screening on color
   fundus photographs (CFP) and segmentation of retinal fluid on optical
   coherence tomography (OCT) images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
   is the main AI technique in generative AI in retinal imaging. Novel
   images generated by GAN can be applied for training AI models in
   imbalanced or inadequate datasets. Foundation models are also recent
   advances in retinal imaging. They are pretrained with huge datasets,
   such as millions of CFP and OCT images and fine-tuned for downstream
   tasks with much smaller datasets. A foundation model, RETFound, which
   was self-supervised and found to discriminate many eye and systemic
   diseases better than supervised models. Large language models are
   foundation models that may be applied for text-related tasks, like
   reports of retinal angiography. Whereas AI technology moves forward
   fast, real-world use of AI models moves slowly, making the gap between
   development and deployment even wider. Strong evidence showing AI models
   can prevent visual loss may be required to close this gap.},

Abstract = {As the next-generation wireless communication system, sixth-generation
   (6G) technologies are emerging, enabling various mobile edge networks
   that can revolutionize wireless communication and connectivity. By
   integrating generative artificial intelligence (GAI) with mobile edge
   networks, generative mobile edge networks possess immense potential to
   enhance the intelligence and efficiency of wireless communication
   networks. In this article, we propose the concept of generative mobile
   edge networks and overview widely adopted GAI technologies and their
   applications in mobile edge networks. We then discuss the potential
   challenges faced by generative mobile edge networks in
   resource-constrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we develop
   a universal resource-efficient generative incentive mechanism framework,
   in which we design resource-efficient methods for network overhead
   reduction, formulate appropriate incentive mechanisms for the resource
   allocation problem, and utilize generative diffusion models (GDMs) to
   find the optimal incentive mechanism solutions. Furthermore, we conduct
   a case study on resource-constrained mobile edge networks, employing
   model partitioning for efficient AI task offloading, and proposing a
   GDM-based Stackelberg model to motivate edge devices to contribute
   computing resources for mobile edge intelligence. Finally, we propose
   several open directions that could contribute to the future popularity
   of generative mobile edge networks.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs)
   are poised to significantly impact social work research. These

   In this paper, we use a disruptive-disrupting framework to discuss the
   dual nature of generative AI and LLMs and offer recommendations for
   social work researchers and journal editors that include guidance around
   data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination.
   Researchers must use great caution when deploying generative AI
   technologies, meticulously examining, verifying, and taking
   accountability for the text and analyses produced by these instruments.
   Likewise, journal editors will need to implement quality control
   procedures and ethical standards to guide and evaluate the use of these

   Juxtaposing two empirical use cases-autonomous vehicles and virtual
   influencers-the article problematises the convergence of simulation and
   reality through the lens of video game engines. Although those case
   studies seem to be at odds with each other, they illustrate the
   mechanisms of new profit models built on rent extraction. Consequently,
   far from ushering a Matrix-style simulation that cannot be theorized,
   hyperproduction remains not only grounded in, but also bounded by,
   reality: the reality of rentier capitalism.},

Abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has
   significantly transformed learning patterns and innovative approaches.
   Human-machine (generative artificial intelligence) co-creation will
   become the norm, necessitating that learners possess the requisite AI
   literacy (AIL) to adapt to this shift. The mechanisms by which
   individual AIL influences innovative behavior (IB) in human-machine
   collaborative environments remain unclear. Therefore, this study,
   grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), employs a snowball
   sampling method to survey 460 university students, utilizing structural
   equation modeling to analyze the relationships among their AI literacy
   (AIL), psychological need satisfaction (PNS), creative self-efficacy
   (CSE), self-regulated learning (SRL), and innovative behavior (IB). The
   results indicate that AIL does not directly influence learners' IB. PNS,
   CSE, and SRL serve as mediators between AIL and IB. Furthermore, AIL
   influences learners' PNS and CSE in innovative activities, which in turn
   affects their use of SRL to adjust their innovation processes, thereby
   promoting the application of GAI in generating IB.},

Abstract = {The current study explores continuous intention (CI) to use generative
   artificial intelligence (GenAI) as an educational tool among university
   students through the prism of a post-pandemic theoretical framework.
   Despite GenAI technology's latest launch in the academia sector, very
   little has been done to evaluate its effects. To examine what factors
   impact the continuous intention to use GenAI, this paper contemplates
   incorporating the technology acceptance model with self-determination
   theory. University students were requested to fill out questionnaire
   forms that were designed to gather data for the proposed model. A hybrid
   approach combining a linear partial least squares structural equation
   modeling model with compensation and a non-linear artificial neural
   network (ANN) model without compensation is used to investigate the
   effect of CI on the use of GenAI as an educational tool. The empirical
   results indicated that perceived usefulness and autonomy are significant
   predictors of the continued intention to use GenAI in the Thai context.
   However, the CI was unaffected by perceived ease of use. Additionally,
   the ANN model indicates that relatedness is the most important
   predictor. Overall, theoretical and practical ramifications are
   addressed.},

Abstract = {Since ChatGPT launch in November 2022, artificial intelligence has
   become more and more widespread in all areas of life. Generative
   applications of artificial intelligence are proliferating in a wide
   range of fields. The technology has great potential for applications
   such as machine translation, voice recognition, education, or content
   creation, but it also raises concerns about misuse, ethical use, and
   plagiarism. As texts generated by artificial intelligence tools continue
   to improve, detection tools on the market will have to involve
   additional efforts to keep pace. This article uses data from the Scopus
   and Web of Science databases to map the current usability of detectors,
   of texts generated by artificial intelligence, in higher education and
   academia. One of the aims of the article is to provide an insight into
   the experiences with currently available detectors of texts generated by
   artificial intelligence in higher education.},

Title = {Examining Recommendations for Generative Artificial Intelligence Use
   with Integrity from a Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Lens},
Journal = {RELIEVE-REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE INVESTIGACION Y EVALUACION EDUCATIVA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {New developments in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field allowed the
   development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), capable of
   creating text resembling what humans can produce. As a result,
   educators' concerns in the higher education sector quickly emerged. Many
   organizations and experts have addressed these concerns through
   recommendations. In this conceptual paper, we draw from the Integrated
   Model for Academic Integrity through a Scholarship of Teaching and
   Learning Lens to examine and stimulate discussion from twelve documents
   that focus on using GenAI with integrity. We identified recommendations
   suitable for the individual (micro), the departmental/program (meso),
   the institutional (macro), and the interinstitutional/ national/
   international (mega) levels concerning two core elements of the model:
   ``high-impact professional learning for individuals and groups{''} and
   ``local-level leadership and microcultures.{''} Suggestions around the
   core element ``scholarship, research and inquiry{''} were lacking at the
   micro and meso levels; likewise, recommendations for the core element
   ``learning spaces, pedagogies, and technologies{''} were also absent at
   the meso, macro, and mega levels. We acknowledge that these
   recommendations focus on learning, involve various stakeholders, and go
   beyond student conduct, which aligns with current approaches to academic
   integrity. However, some gaps need further exploration. We highlight the
   need to develop more specific and practical guidance and resources for
   educational stakeholders around GenAI issues related to academic
   integrity, explore how to better support networks and leaders in higher
   education in creating the conditions for ethical GenAI use, and
   emphasizing the need for an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion lens on
   GenAI.},

Title = {The Societal Impacts of Generative Artificial Intelligence: A Balanced
   Perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1, SI},
Abstract = {The discourse surrounding the societal impacts of generative artificial
   intelligence (GAI), exemplified by technologies like ChatGPT, often
   oscillates between extremes: utopian visions of unprecedented
   productivity and dystopian fears of humanity's demise. This polarized
   perspective neglects the nuanced, pragmatic manifestation of GAI. In
   general, extreme views oversimplify the technology itself or its
   potential to address societal issues. The authors suggest a more
   balanced analysis, acknowledging that GAI's impacts will unfold
   dynamically over time as diverse implementations interact with human
   stakeholders and contextual factors. While Big Tech firms dominate GAI's
   supply, its demand is expected to evolve through experimentation and use
   cases. The authors argue that GAI's societal impact depends on
   identifiable contingencies, emphasizing three broad factors: the balance
   between automation and augmentation, the congruence of physical and
   digital realities, and the retention of human bounded rationality. These
   contingencies represent trade-offs arising from GAI instantiations,
   shaped by technological advancements, stakeholder dynamics, and
   contextual factors, including societal responses and regulations.
   Predicting long-term societal effects remains challenging due to
   unforeseeable discontinuities in the technology's trajectory. The
   authors anticipate a continuous interplay between GAI initiatives,
   technological advances, learning experiences, and societal responses,
   with outcomes depending on the above contingencies.},

Abstract = {With artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly involved in the creation
   of organizational and commercial artifacts, human evaluators' role as
   creativity gatekeepers of AI-produced artifacts will become critical for
   innovation processes. However, when humans evaluate creativity, their
   judgment is clouded by biases triggered by the characteristics of the
   creator. Drawing from folk psychology and algorithm aversion research,
   we examine whether the identity of the producer of a given artifact as
   artificial intelligence (AI) or human is a source of bias affecting
   people's creativity evaluation of such artifact and what drives this
   effect. With four experimental studies (N = 2039), of which two were
   pre-registered, using different experimental designs and evaluation
   targets, we found that people sometimes-but not always-ascribe lower
   creativity to a product when they are told that the producer is an AI
   rather than a human. In addition, we found that people consistently
   perceive generative AI to exert less effort than humans in the creation
   of a given artifact, which drives the lower creativity ratings ascribed
   to generative AI producers. We discuss the implication of these findings
   for organizational creativity and innovation in the context of human-AI
   interaction.},

   Impacts, and Mitigation Strategies},
Journal = {SCI},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 26},
Abstract = {The significant advancements in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to
   healthcare decision-making, medical diagnosis, and other domains have
   simultaneously raised concerns about the fairness and bias of AI
   systems. This is particularly critical in areas like healthcare,
   employment, criminal justice, credit scoring, and increasingly, in
   generative AI models (GenAI) that produce synthetic media. Such systems
   can lead to unfair outcomes and perpetuate existing inequalities,
   including generative biases that affect the representation of
   individuals in synthetic data. This survey study offers a succinct,
   comprehensive overview of fairness and bias in AI, addressing their
   sources, impacts, and mitigation strategies. We review sources of bias,
   such as data, algorithm, and human decision biases-highlighting the
   emergent issue of generative AI bias, where models may reproduce and
   amplify societal stereotypes. We assess the societal impact of biased AI
   systems, focusing on perpetuating inequalities and reinforcing harmful
   stereotypes, especially as generative AI becomes more prevalent in
   creating content that influences public perception. We explore various
   proposed mitigation strategies, discuss the ethical considerations of
   their implementation, and emphasize the need for interdisciplinary
   collaboration to ensure effectiveness. Through a systematic literature
   review spanning multiple academic disciplines, we present definitions of
   AI bias and its different types, including a detailed look at generative
   AI bias. We discuss the negative impacts of AI bias on individuals and
   society and provide an overview of current approaches to mitigate AI
   bias, including data pre-processing, model selection, and
   post-processing. We emphasize the unique challenges presented by
   generative AI models and the importance of strategies specifically
   tailored to address these. Addressing bias in AI requires a holistic
   approach involving diverse and representative datasets, enhanced
   transparency and accountability in AI systems, and the exploration of
   alternative AI paradigms that prioritize fairness and ethical
   considerations. This survey contributes to the ongoing discussion on
   developing fair and unbiased AI systems by providing an overview of the
   sources, impacts, and mitigation strategies related to AI bias, with a
   particular focus on the emerging field of generative AI.},

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {As the demand for deep mineral resource extraction intensifies,
   optimizing pipeline transportation systems in backfill mining has become
   increasingly critical. Thus, reducing energy loss while ensuring the
   filling effect becomes crucial for improving process efficiency. Owing
   to variations among mines, accurately calculating pipeline resistance
   loss remains challenging, resulting in significant inaccuracies. The
   rapid development of Industry 4.0 provides intelligent and data-driven
   optimization ideas for this challenge. This study introduces a novel
   pipeline resistance loss prediction framework integrating generative
   artificial intelligence with a TransKAN model. This study employs
   generative artificial intelligence to produce physically constrained
   augmented data, integrates the KAN network's B-spline basis functions
   for nonlinear feature extraction, and incorporates the Transformer
   architecture to capture spatio-temporal correlations in pipeline
   pressure sequences, enabling precise resistance loss calculation. The
   experimental data collected from pipeline pressure sensors provides
   empirical validation for the model. Compared with traditional
   mathematical formulas, BP neural networks, SVMs, and random forests, the
   proposed model demonstrates superior performance, achieving an R2 value
   of 0.9644, an RMSE of 0.7126, and an MAE of 0.4703.},

   While much of the study of gender bias in popular GAI systems is focused
   on text-based GAI such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini (formerly
   Bard), this article describes the results of a confirmatory experiment
   of gender bias in visual GAI systems. The authors argue that the
   potential for gender bias in visual GAI systems is potentially more
   troubling than bias in textual GAI because of the superior memorability
   of images and the capacity for emotional communication that images
   represent. They go on to offer four potential approaches to gender bias
   in visual GAI based on the roles visual GAI could play in modern
   society. The article concludes with a discussion of how dominant
   societal values could influence a choice between those four potential
   approaches to gender bias in visual GAI and some suggestions for further
   research.},

   discusses the Ethics of AI, focusing on artificial moral agency (AMA),
   with the purpose of investigating whether AI can possess moral agency
   similar to human beings, or more precisely, have a moral experience. We
   argue that AI lacks the intrinsic capacity provided by freedom for moral
   agency. By employing cybernetic approaches and systems theory, we
   conclude that AI emulates `principles of judgment' by adhering to
   extrinsic norms, highlighting the need for reflection on AMA and its

Title = {Generative artificial intelligence in manufacturing: applications, case
   studies, and future directions for next-generation intelligent
   production systems},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 22},
Abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into
   manufacturing processes is emerging as a transformative strategy to
   enhance automation, optimize workflows, and foster innovation in
   intelligent production systems. Unlike traditional rule-based
   automation, generative AI leverages advanced machine learning (ML) and
   deep learning (DL) models to enable autonomous decision-making, adaptive
   process refinement, and real-time data generation. This paradigm shift
   facilitates a range of advanced applications, including AI-driven
   product design optimization, proactive maintenance, intelligent quality
   control, and dynamic supply chain management. This study explores the
   potential of generative AI to redefine modern manufacturing by providing
   scalable, data-driven solutions that minimize downtime, reduce waste,
   and support sustainable production goals. In particular, we highlight
   the role of generative models in creating synthetic datasets for model
   training, enabling real-time defect detection, and supporting
   hyper-personalized production. The self-learning and pattern recognition
   capabilities of generative AI empower manufacturing systems to
   dynamically adapt to evolving operational requirements. To evaluate
   practical implications, three case studies are presented that
   demonstrate the implementation and impact of generative AI in diverse
   manufacturing scenarios. These cases underscore both the opportunities
   and challenges associated with deployment, including high computational
   demands, data security concerns, and integration with legacy systems.
   Ethical considerations such as bias mitigation and model transparency
   are also discussed as critical components of responsible AI adoption.
   Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of generative AI
   applications in manufacturing, offering insights into how these
   technologies can support the next generation of intelligent, adaptive,
   and sustainable production systems.},

Title = {Exploring pre-service teachers' attitudes and experiences with
   generative AI: a mixed methods study in Norwegian teacher education},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 8},
Abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including generative AI
   (GenAI), evolve, they offer new opportunities for information access and
   feedback across disciplines. However, limited research has examined
   pre-service teachers' attitudes towards GenAI, particularly their
   perceptions, experiences, and usage. This study addresses the gap using
   a mixed methods approach, combining survey data from 209 Norwegian
   pre-service teachers with interviews from 11 of the same participants.
   Most were aware of GenAI and had used AI tools, though none considered
   themselves experts. Statistical analysis identified key predictors of AI
   knowledge and beliefs about GenAI's usefulness in teaching. Participants
   acknowledged GenAI's practical benefits for lesson planning and content
   discovery but raised concerns about its trustworthiness and implications
   for human-centred education. Interviews offered deeper insight into
   differences between experienced and novice users. The study highlights
   implications for teacher education, emphasising the need to develop AI
   competency to prepare future educators for an increasingly digital
   landscape.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the need to integrate ethical, human-centered
   principles into user experience (UX) design for generative AI
   (GenAI)-based assistants. Acknowledging the ethical and societal
   challenges posed by the democratization of GenAI, this study developed a
   set of six UX design guidelines and 37 recommendations to guide
   development teams in creating GenAI assistants. A card-based toolkit was
   designed to encapsulate these guidelines, applying color theory and
   Gestalt principles to enhance usability and understanding. The design
   science research methodology (DSRM) was followed, and the toolkit was
   validated through a hands-on workshop with software and UX
   professionals, assessing usability, user experience, and utility. The
   quantitative results indicated the high internal consistency and
   effectiveness of the toolkit, while the qualitative analysis highlighted
   its capacity to foster collaboration and address GenAI-specific
   challenges. This study concludes that the toolkit improves usability and
   utility in UX design for GenAI-based assistants, though it identifies
   areas for future enhancement and the need for further validation across
   varied contexts.},

   Societal Impact, and Opportunities for Information Systems Research},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 25},
Abstract = {The continuing, explosive developments in generative artificial
   intelligence (GenAI), built on large language models and related
   algorithms, has led to much excitement and speculation about the
   potential impact of this new technology. Claims include artificial
   intelligence (AI) being poised to revolutionize business and society and
   dramatically change personal life. However, it is not clear how this
   technology, with its significantly distinct features from past AI
   technologies, has transformative potential or how researchers in
   information systems should react to it. In this paper, we consider the
   evolving and emerging trends of AI in order to examine its present and
   predict its future impacts. Many existing papers on GenAI are either too
   technical for most information systems researchers or lack the depth
   needed to appreciate the potential impacts of GenAI. We, therefore,
   attempt to bridge the technical and organizational communities of GenAI
   from a system-oriented sociotechnical perspective. Specifically, we
   explore the unique features of GenAI, which are rooted in the continued
   change from symbolism to connectionism, and the deep systemic and
   inherent properties of human-AI ecosystems. We retrace the evolution of
   AI that proceeded the level of adoption, adaption, and use found today,
   in order to propose future research on various impacts of GenAI in both
   business and society within the context of information systems research.
   Our efforts are intended to contribute to the creation of a
   well-structured research agenda in the information systems community to
   support innovative strategies and operations enabled by this new wave of
   AI.},

Abstract = {This study explores the role of social influence in the adoption
   strategies of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) among graduate
   and undergraduate students. Using the Unified Theory of the Acceptance
   and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and its key behaviour intention
   determinant, social influence, the relationship between GenAI popularity
   among peers and its use intention was examined. Survey data (271 UAE
   university students) revealed a significant relationship between social
   influence and GenAI use intention, with undergraduate students being
   more affected by peers than graduates. This difference may be explained
   by higher autonomy, level of independence, and less cohesive peer
   networks among graduate students. The increased GenAI popularity among
   undergraduate students can also be attributed to some degree to the
   non-voluntary nature of their environment and a stronger peer influence.
   The study contributes to UTAUT advancement by extending the social
   influence construct to voluntary and non-voluntary GenAI use settings.},
