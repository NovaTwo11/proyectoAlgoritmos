Abstract = {While all functional areas in organizations are benefiting from the
   recent development in generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
   marketing has been particularly affected positively by this breakthrough
   innovation. However, scholars have not paid attention to the
   transformative impacts GAI has on marketing activities. This editorial
   article aims to fill this void. It outlines the current state of
   generative artificial intelligence in marketing. The article discusses
   the facilitators and barriers for the use of generative artificial
   intelligence in marketing. It highlights the effectiveness of insights
   generated by GAI in personalizing content and offerings and argues that
   marketing content generated by GAI is likely to be more personally
   relevant than that produced by earlier generations of digital
   technologies. The article explains how higher efficiency and
   productivity of marketing activities can be achieved by using GAI to
   create marketing content. It also describes the roles of insights and
   marketing content generated by GAI to improve the sales lead generation
   process. Implications for research, practice and policy are also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) advancements have ignited new
   expectations for artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled educational
   transformations. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this
   study combines structural equation modeling and interviews to analyze
   the influencing factors of Chinese university students' GAI technology
   usage intention. Regarding AI literacy, students' cognitive literacy in
   AI ethics scored the highest (M = 5.740), while AI awareness literacy
   scored the lowest (M = 4.578). Students' attitudes toward GAI
   significantly and positively influenced their usage intention, with the
   combined TPB framework and AI literacy explaining 59.3\% of the
   variance. AI literacy and subjective norms positively influenced
   students' attitudes toward GAI technology and perceived behavioral
   control, and attitude mediated the impact of AI literacy and subjective
   norms on GAI usage intention. Further, the interviews provide new
   insights for university management and educational leadership regarding
   the construction of an educational ecosystem under the application of

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds the potential to
   transform the delivery, cultivation and evaluation of human learning.
   Here the authors examine the integration of GenAI as a tool for human
   learning, addressing its promises and challenges from a holistic
   viewpoint that integrates insights from learning sciences, educational
   technology and human-computer interaction. GenAI promises to enhance
   learning experiences by scaling personalized support, diversifying
   learning materials, enabling timely feedback and innovating assessment
   methods. However, it also presents critical issues such as model
   imperfections, ethical dilemmas and the disruption of traditional
   assessments. Thus, cultivating AI literacy and adaptive skills is
   imperative for facilitating informed engagement with GenAI technologies.
   Rigorous research across learning contexts is essential to evaluate
   GenAI's effect on human cognition, metacognition and creativity.
   Humanity must learn with and about GenAI, ensuring that it becomes a
   powerful ally in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation, rather than a
   crutch that undermines our intellectual abilities.
   This Perspective describes the roles of generative AI in providing
   personalized support, diversity and innovative assessment in learning.
   However, it also raises ethical concerns and highlights issues such as
   model imperfection, underscoring the need for AI literacy and
   adaptability.},

Abstract = {It is increasingly common to interact with products that seem
   ``intelligent{''}, although the label ``artificial intelligence{''} may
   have been replaced by other euphemisms. Since November 2022, with the
   emergence of the ChatGPT tool, there has been an exponential increase in
   the use of artificial intelligence in all areas. Although ChatGPT is
   just one of many generative artificial intelligence technologies, its
   impact on teaching and learning processes has been significant. This
   article reflects on the advantages, disadvantages, potentials, limits,
   and challenges of generative artificial intelligence technologies in
   education to avoid the biases inherent in extremist positions. To this
   end, we conducted a systematic review of both the tools and the
   scientific production that have emerged in the six months since the
   appearance of ChatGPT. Generative artificial intelligence is extremely
   powerful and improving at an accelerated pace, but it is based on large
   language models with a probabilistic basis, which means that they have
   no capacity for reasoning or comprehension and are therefore susceptible
   to containing errors that need to be contrasted. On the other hand, many
   of the problems associated with these technologies in educational
   contexts already existed before their appearance, but now, due to their
   power, we cannot ignore them, and we must assume what our speed of
   response will be to analyse and incorporate these tools into our
   teaching practice.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence provides both opportunities and
   challenges for higher education. Existing literature has not properly
   investigated how this technology would impact assessment in higher
   education. This scoping review took a forward-thinking approach to
   investigate how generative artificial intelligence transforms assessment
   in higher education. We used the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews to
   select articles for review and report the results. In the screening, we
   retrieved 969 articles and selected 32 empirical studies for analysis.
   Most of the articles were published in 2023. We used three
   levels-students, teachers, and institutions-to analyses the articles.
   Our results suggested that assessment should be transformed to cultivate
   students' self-regulated learning skills, responsible learning, and
   integrity. To successfully transform assessment in higher education, the
   review suggested that (i) teacher professional development activities
   for assessment, AI, and digital literacy should be provided, (ii)
   teachers' beliefs about human and AI assessment should be strengthened,
   and (iii) teachers should be innovative and holistic in their teaching
   to reflect the assessment transformation. Educational institutions are
   recommended to review and rethink their assessment policies, as well as
   provide more inter-disciplinary programs and teaching.},

   authenticity, the results of three experimental studies indicate that
   brands' GenAI adoption induces negative attitudinal and behavioral
   follower reactions. These effects are mediated by followers' perceptions
   of brand authenticity and can be triggered by GenAI disclosure. Negative
   reactions are attenuated if GenAI is used to assist humans in content
   creation rather than to replace them through automation. Our findings
   underscore the need for nuance in brands' GenAI adoption to unlock
   economic benefits without compromising on relationships with consumers.},

Abstract = {There has been widespread media commentary about the potential impact of
   generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT on the Education
   field, but little examination at scale of how educators believe teaching
   and assessment should change as a result of generative AI. This mixed
   methods study examines the views of educators (n = 318) from a diverse
   range of teaching levels, experience levels, discipline areas, and
   regions about the impact of AI on teaching and assessment, the ways that
   they believe teaching and assessment should change, and the key
   motivations for changing their practices. The majority of teachers felt
   that generative AI would have a major or profound impact on teaching and
   assessment, though a sizeable minority felt it would have a little or no
   impact. Teaching level, experience, discipline area, region, and gender
   all significantly influenced perceived impact of generative AI on
   teaching and assessment. Higher levels of awareness of generative AI
   predicted higher perceived impact, pointing to the possibility of an
   `ignorance effect'. Thematic analysis revealed the specific curriculum,
   pedagogy, and assessment changes that teachers feel are needed as a
   result of generative AI, which centre around learning with AI,
   higher-order thinking, ethical values, a focus on learning processes and
   face-to-face relational learning. Teachers were most motivated to change
   their teaching and assessment practices to increase the performance
   expectancy of their students and themselves. We conclude by discussing
   the implications of these findings in a world with increasingly

   survey. Results showed that only 7\% of students who responded had not
   heard of any GAI technologies, whilst over half had used or considered
   using these for academic purposes. The majority of students (54.1\%)
   were supportive or somewhat supportive of using tools such as Grammarly,
   but 70.4\% were unsupportive or somewhat unsupportive towards students
   using tools such as ChatGPT to write their whole essay. Students who had
   higher levels of confidence in their academic writing were less likely
   to use or consider using them for academic purposes, and were also less
   likely to be supportive of other students using them. Most students
   (41.1\%) also thought there should be a university wide policy on when
   these technologies are or are not appropriate to use. The results of
   this research suggest that students require clear policies on the use of
   GAI and that these technologies should not be banned from university,
   but consideration must be made to ensure different groups of students
   have equal access to the technologies.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly increased capacity
   for producing textual, visual and auditory outputs, yet there are
   ongoing concerns regarding the quality of those outputs. There is an
   urgent need to develop students' evaluative judgement - the capability
   to judge the quality of work of self and others - in recognition of this
   new reality. In this conceptual paper, we describe the intersection
   between evaluative judgement and generative AI with a view to
   articulating how assessment practices can help students learn to work
   productively with generative AI. We propose three foci: (1) developing
   evaluative judgement of generative AI outputs; (2) developing evaluative
   judgement of generative AI processes; and (3) generative AI assessment
   of student evaluative judgements. We argue for developing students'
   capabilities to identify and calibrate quality of work - uniquely human
   capabilities at a time of technological acceleration - through existing
   formative assessment strategies. These approaches circumvent and
   interrupt students' uncritical usage of generative AI. The relationship
   between evaluative judgement and generative AI is more than just the
   application of human judgement to machine outputs. We have a collective
   responsibility, as educators and learners, to ensure that humans do not
   relinquish their roles as arbiters of quality.},

   paper aims to introduce some of the basic concepts of AI and Gen-AI. The
   approach of this explanatory paper is first to introduce some of the
   underlying concepts, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning,
   deep learning, artificial neural networks, and large language models
   (LLMs), that would allow the reader to better understand generative AI.
   The paper also discusses some of the applications and implications of
   generative AI on businesses and education, followed by the current
   challenges associated with generative AI.},

Title = {A Human-Centered Learning and Teaching Framework Using Generative
   Artificial Intelligence for Self-Regulated Learning Development Through
   Domain Knowledge Learning in K-12 Settings},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {1588-1599},
Abstract = {The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited an
   increase in discussions about generative AI tools in education. In this
   study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses
   generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through
   domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in
   educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools
   can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of
   teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the
   evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful
   facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated
   instructions and attempt to develop students' individualized learning.
   Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students
   to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate
   active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage
   self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers
   equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their
   teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges.
   The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case
   study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability
   among primary students within a K-12 educational context. This article
   also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers.
   Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of
   the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative
   AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and
   increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that
   would enhance students' attention, engagement, confidence, and
   satisfaction.},

Journal = {INFORMATION},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence has been attracting the attention of educational
   researchers recently, especially ChatGPT as a generative artificial
   intelligence tool. The context of generative artificial intelligence
   could impact different aspects of students' learning, such as the
   motivational aspect. The present research intended to investigate the
   characteristics of students' task motivation in the artificial
   intelligence context, specifically in the ChatGPT context. The
   researchers interviewed 15 students about their experiences with ChatGPT
   to collect data. The researchers used inductive and deductive content
   analysis to investigate students' motivation when learning with ChatGPT.
   To arrive at the categories and sub-categories of students' motivation,
   the researchers used the MAXQDA 2022. Five main categories emerged: task
   enjoyment, reported effort, result assessment, perceived relevance, and
   interaction. Each category comprised at least two sub-categories, and
   each sub-category was further organized into codes. The results
   indicated more positive characteristics of motivation than negative
   ones. The previous results could be due to the conversational or social
   aspect of the chatbot, enabling relationships with humans and enabling
   the maintenance of good quality conversations with them. We conclude
   that a generative AI could be utilized in educational settings to
   promote students' motivation to learn and thus raise their learning
   achievement.},

   recent advances, challenges, and opportunities},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {There are two main ways to discover or design small drug molecules. The
   first involves fine-tuning existing molecules or commercially successful
   drugs through quantitative structure-activity relationships and virtual
   screening. The second approach involves generating new molecules through
   de novo drug design or inverse quantitative structure-activity
   relationship. Both methods aim to get a drug molecule with the best
   pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. However, bringing a new
   drug to market is an expensive and time-consuming endeavor, with the
   average cost being estimated at around \$2.5 billion. One of the biggest
   challenges is screening the vast number of potential drug candidates to
   find one that is both safe and effective. The development of artificial
   intelligence in recent years has been phenomenal, ushering in a
   revolution in many fields. The field of pharmaceutical sciences has also
   significantly benefited from multiple applications of artificial
   intelligence, especially drug discovery projects. Artificial
   intelligence models are finding use in molecular property prediction,
   molecule generation, virtual screening, synthesis planning, repurposing,
   among others. Lately, generative artificial intelligence has gained
   popularity across domains for its ability to generate entirely new data,
   such as images, sentences, audios, videos, novel chemical molecules,
   etc. Generative artificial intelligence has also delivered promising
   results in drug discovery and development. This review article delves
   into the fundamentals and framework of various generative artificial
   intelligence models in the context of drug discovery via de novo drug
   design approach. Various basic and advanced models have been discussed,
   along with their recent applications. The review also explores recent
   examples and advances in the generative artificial intelligence
   approach, as well as the challenges and ongoing efforts to fully harness
   the potential of generative artificial intelligence in generating novel
   drug molecules in a faster and more affordable manner. Some
   clinical-level assets generated form generative artificial intelligence
   have also been discussed in this review to show the ever-increasing
   application of artificial intelligence in drug discovery through
   commercial partnerships.},

   Generative Artificial Intelligence on Psychotherapy},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {This paper explores a significant shift in the field of mental health in
   general and psychotherapy in particular following generative artificial
   intelligence's new capabilities in processing and generating humanlike
   language. Following Freud, this lingo-technological development is
   conceptualized as the ``fourth narcissistic blow{''} that science
   inflicts on humanity. We argue that this narcissistic blow has a
   potentially dramatic influence on perceptions of human society,
   interrelationships, and the self. We should, accordingly, expect
   dramatic changes in perceptions of the therapeutic act following the
   emergence of what we term the artificial third in the field of
   psychotherapy. The introduction of an artificial third marks a critical
   juncture, prompting us to ask the following important core questions
   that address two basic elements of critical thinking, namely,
   transparency and autonomy: (1) What is this new artificial presence in
   therapy relationships? (2) How does it reshape our perception of
   ourselves and our interpersonal dynamics? and (3) What remains of the
   irreplaceable human elements at the core of therapy? Given the ethical
   implications that arise from these questions, this paper proposes that
   the artificial third can be a valuable asset when applied with insight
   and ethical consideration, enhancing but not replacing the human touch
   in therapy.},

   agreement in business model rankings made by large language models

   educational landscape. This research paper investigates the impact of
   incorporating generative AI into adaptive and personalized learning
   environments, with a focus on tracing the evolution from conventional
   artificial intelligence methods to generative AI and identifying its
   diverse applications in education. The study begins with a comprehensive
   review of the evolution of generative AI models and frameworks. A
   framework of selection criteria is established to curate case studies
   showcasing the applications of generative AI in education. These case
   studies are analysed to elucidate the benefits and challenges associated
   with integrating generative AI into adaptive learning frameworks.
   Through an in-depth analysis of selected case studies, the study reveals
   tangible benefits derived from generative AI integration, including
   increased student engagement, improved test scores and accelerated skill
   development. Ethical, technical and pedagogical challenges related to
   generative AI integration are identified, emphasizing the need for
   careful consideration and collaborative efforts between educators and

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is able to collect, extract, digest,

   first surgical applications of generative artificial intelligence are
   applied, this perspective paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview
   of current applications and future perspectives for the application of
   generative artificial intelligence in surgery, from preoperative
   planning to training. Generative artificial intelligence can be used
   before surgery for planning and decision support by extracting patient
   information and providing patients with information and simulation
   regarding the procedure. Intraoperatively, generative artificial
   intelligence can document data that is normally not captured as
   intraoperative adverse events or provide information to help
   decision-making. Postoperatively, GAIs can help with patient discharge
   and follow-up. The ability to provide real-time feedback and store it
   for later review is an important capability of GAIs. GAI applications
   are emerging as highly specialized, task-specific tools for tasks such
   as data extraction, synthesis, presentation, and communication within
   the realm of surgery. GAIs have the potential to play a pivotal role in
   facilitating interaction between surgeons and artificial intelligence.

   beginning, the paper has highlighted conceptual delimitations regarding
   artificial intelligence and its applications in education, along with
   advantages and limitations, highlighting that the adoption of generative
   artificial intelligence solutions, such as ChatGPT, in higher education
   in economics has been relatively underexplored in the literature. In
   order to cover these gaps identified in the literature, have been
   presented, in the second part of the paper, the methodology and results
   of an exploratory research, conducted on a sample of 364 undergraduate
   and master's students at the Faculty of Business and Tourism within the

Abstract = {Multiscale design of catalyst layers (CLs) is important to advancing
   hydrogen electrochemical conversion devices toward commercialized
   deployment, which has nevertheless been greatly hampered by the complex
   interplay among multiscale CL components, high synthesis cost and vast
   design space. We lack rational design and optimization techniques that
   can accurately reflect the nanostructure-performance relationship and
   cost-effectively search the design space. Here, we fill this gap with a
   deep generative artificial intelligence (AI) framework, GLIDER, that
   integrates recent generative AI, data-driven surrogate techniques and
   collective intelligence to efficiently search the optimal CL
   nanostructures driven by their electrochemical performance. GLIDER
   achieves realistic multiscale CL digital generation by leveraging the
   dimensionality-reduction ability of quantized vector-variational
   autoencoder. The powerful generative capability of GLIDER allows the
   efficient search of the optimal design parameters for the
   Pt-carbon-ionomer nanostructures of CLs. We also demonstrate that GLIDER
   is transferable to other fuel cell electrode microstructure generation,
   e.g., fibrous gas diffusion layers and solid oxide fuel cell anode.
   GLIDER is of potential as a digital tool for the design and optimization

   Digital twins, which are in silico replications of an individual and its
   environment, have advanced clinical decision-making and prognostication
   in cardiovascular medicine. The technology enables personalized
   simulations of clinical scenarios, prediction of disease risk, and
   strategies for clinical trial augmentation. Current applications of
   cardiovascular digital twins have integrated multi-modal data into
   mechanistic and statistical models to build physiologically accurate
   cardiac replicas to enhance disease phenotyping, enrich diagnostic
   workflows, and optimize procedural planning. Digital twin technology is
   rapidly evolving in the setting of newly available data modalities and
   advances in generative artificial intelligence, enabling dynamic and
   comprehensive simulations unique to an individual. These twins fuse
   physiologic, environmental, and healthcare data into machine learning
   and generative models to build real-time patient predictions that can
   model interactions with the clinical environment to accelerate
   personalized patient care. This review summarizes digital twins in
   cardiovascular medicine and their potential future applications by
   incorporating new personalized data modalities. It examines the
   technical advances in deep learning and generative artificial
   intelligence that broaden the scope and predictive power of digital
   twins. Finally, it highlights the individual and societal challenges as
   well as ethical considerations that are essential to realizing the
   future vision of incorporating cardiology digital twins into

   existence of two distinct generative levels in GenAI: one leading to the
   generation of new artifacts and the other leading to the generation of

   generativity of both of these levels, thus specifically confirming the

Abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve rapidly, its
   integration into nursing education is inevitable. This article presents
   a narrative exploring the implementation of generative AI in nursing
   education and offers a guide for its strategic use. The exploration
   begins with an examination of the broader societal impact and uses of
   artificial intelligence, recognizing its pervasive presence and the
   potential it holds. Thematic analysis of strengths, weaknesses,
   opportunities, and threats collected from nurse educators across the
   southeastern United States in this case-based descriptive study used
   four codes: time, innovation, critical thinking, and routine tasks.
   Findings from the qualitative analysis revealed the overarching themes
   that AI can serve as both a tool and a tyrant, offering opportunities
   for efficiency and innovation while posing challenges of transparency,
   ethical use, and AI literacy. By establishing ethical guidelines,
   fostering AI literacy, and promoting responsible implementation in
   nursing education with a clear articulation of expectations, nurse
   educators can guide and guard the use of generative AI. Despite the
   concerns, the transformative potential of generative AI to enhance
   teaching methodologies and prepare students for the interprofessional
   health-care workforce provides a multitude of innovative opportunities
   for teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (as well as generative AI) has been increasingly
   applied in the tourism and hospitality industry and has an important
   impact on the work behavior of practitioners. Drawing from the
   transactional theory of stress and coping, this study is to clarify the
   mechanism of potential negative impact of AI on the work outcomes of
   tourism and hospitality practitioners who use generative AI (GenAI) to
   assist their work. This study conducts in-depth interviews and thematic
   analysis to explore how the use of GenAI affects negative work behaviors
   among tourism and hospitality practitioners. The results show that
   employees' technical fear towards AI is negatively associated with their
   sense of realism, self-investment, and habitual perception, but
   positively associated with the perceived threat of job intelligence to
   employment. Moreover, the technical fear towards AI can be positively
   associated with their transgression behavior. The findings of this study
   can be illuminating for helping tourism and hospitality organizations
   develop sustainable and healthy workplace guidelines.},

Abstract = {Few studies have examined user motivations to use generative artificial
   intelligence (AI). This research aims to address this gap by examining
   how user motivations for ChatGPT usage affect perceived creepiness,
   trust, and the intention to continue using AI chatbot technology. The
   findings of an online survey (N = 421) reveal a negative relationship
   between personalization and creepiness, while task efficiency and social
   interaction are positively associated with creepiness. Increased levels
   of creepiness, in turn, result in decreased continuance intention.
   Furthermore, task efficiency and personalization have a positive impact
   on trust, leading to increased continuance intention. The results
   contribute to the field of human-computer interaction by investigating
   the motivations for utilizing generative AI chatbots and advancing our
   comprehension of AI creepiness, trust, and continuance intention. The
   practical ramifications of this research can inform the design of user

   artificial intelligence (AI) systems that generate content, such as
   text, audio, or video, aiming to produce novel and creative outputs
   based on training data. Compared to conversational artificial
   intelligence, generative artificial intelligence systems have the unique
   capability of not only providing replies but also generating the content
   of those responses. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence
   during the Fourth Industrial Revolution, exemplified by tools like
   ChatGPT, have gained popularity and reshaped content production and
   creation. However, the benefits of generative artificial intelligence
   are not equally accessible to all, especially in developing countries,
   where limited access to cutting-edge technologies and inadequate
   infrastructure pose challenges. This paper seeks to understand the
   potential impact of generative AI technologies on developing countries,
   considering economic growth, access to technology, and the potential
   paradigm shift in education, healthcare, and the environment. The
   findings emphasize the importance of providing the necessary support and
   infrastructure to ensure that generative AI contributes to inclusive
   development rather than deepening existing inequalities. The study
   highlights the significance of integrating Generative AI into the

   (Chat Generative Pre -trained Transformer) and Midjourney, have recently
   attracted much attention from researchers and school teachers. While
   many people are eager to learn more about GAI applications, some
   scholars are concerned about the potential misuse of them. It is
   predicted that the use of GAI applications will increase rapidly in the
   coming years. Therefore, it is important to consider the challenges and
   research issues through some concrete application examples of using GAI
   for education. In this position paper, the authors aim to address these
   issues from the perspectives of academic research and educational
   objectives. Along with defining GAI, several illustrative examples of
   using GAI applications in educational settings are provided. Moreover,
   potential research issues of GAI-based learning, including research
   design, relevant learning strategies, research focus, and measuring
   tools, are discussed. ET\&S journal is especially welcoming research on
   unlocking the potential of GAI for education to realize the two notions
   of ``Knowing {[}why] is the essential element for learners to have
   in-depth understanding{''} and ``It is all about prompts: Get rid of the
   `search' mindset and use `programming prompt' instead.{''}},

Abstract = {Introduction: The concept of Digital Twins (DTs) translated to drug
   development and clinical trials describes virtual representations of
   systems of various complexities, ranging from individual cells to entire
   humans, and enables in silico simulations and experiments. DTs increase
   the efficiency of drug discovery and development by digitalizing
   processes associated with high economic, ethical, or social burden. The
   impact is multifaceted: DT models sharpen disease understanding, support
   biomarker discovery and accelerate drug development, thus advancing
   precision medicine. One way to realize DTs is by generative artificial
   intelligence (AI), a cutting-edge technology that enables the creation
   of novel, realistic and complex data with desired properties.Areas
   covered: The authors provide a brief introduction to generative AI and
   describe how it facilitates the modeling of DTs. In addition, they
   compare existing implementations of generative AI for DTs in drug
   discovery and clinical trials. Finally, they discuss technical and
   regulatory challenges that should be addressed before DTs can transform
   drug discovery and clinical trials.Expert opinion: The current state of
   DTs in drug discovery and clinical trials does not exploit the entire
   power of generative AI yet and is limited to simulation of a small
   number of characteristics. Nonetheless, generative AI has the potential
   to transform the field by leveraging recent developments in deep
   learning and customizing models for the needs of scientists, physicians
   and patients.},

Volume = {25},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {At the crossroads of advanced technology and pedagogy, Generative
   Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is, at the very least, prompting a
   reassessment of traditional educational paradigms. Following a frenetic
   year in the advancement of GenAI, particularly after the emergence of
   ChatGPT, there is an intent to explore the impact of GenAI on the
   educational sector, analysed from the perspectives of four key groups:
   teachers, students, decision -makers, and software engineers. Throughout
   2023 and into 2024, literature reviews, interviews, surveys, training
   sessions, and direct observations have been conducted to gauge how GenAI
   is perceived by individuals representing these groups within the
   educational context. It is highlighted how GenAI offers unprecedented
   opportunities for, among other things, personalising learning, enhancing
   the quality of educational resources, and optimising administrative and
   assessment processes. However, the application of GenAI in education
   also has a less favourable aspect related to reservations and mistrust,
   often due to a lack of literacy in issues related to AI in general, but
   also well-founded in some cases due to gaps in legislative, ethical,
   security, or environmental impact aspects. This analysis reveals that,
   although GenAI has the potential to transform education significantly,
   its successful implementation requires a collaborative and
   crosssectional approach involving all actors in the educational
   ecosystem. As we explore this new horizon, it is imperative to consider
   the ethical implications and ensure that technology is used to benefit
   society at large without overlooking the risks and challenges that
   already exist or will inevitably arise with the accelerated development
   of these extremely powerful technologies.},

Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), characterized by its ability to
   generate diverse forms of content including text, images, video and
   audio, has revolutionized many fields, including medical education.
   Generative AI leverages machine learning to create diverse content,
   enabling personalized learning, enhancing resource accessibility, and
   facilitating interactive case studies. This narrative review explores
   the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into
   orthopedic education and training, highlighting its potential, current
   challenges, and future trajectory. A review of recent literature was
   conducted to evaluate the current applications, identify potential
   benefits, and outline limitations of integrating generative AI in
   orthopedic education. Key findings indicate that generative AI holds
   substantial promise in enhancing orthopedic training through its various
   applications such as providing real-time explanations, adaptive learning
   materials tailored to individual student's specific needs, and immersive
   virtual simulations. However, despite its potential, the integration of
   generative AI into orthopedic education faces significant issues such as
   accuracy, bias, inconsistent outputs, ethical and regulatory concerns
   and the critical need for human oversight. Although generative AI models
   such as ChatGPT and others have shown impressive capabilities, their
   current performance on orthopedic exams remains suboptimal, highlighting
   the need for further development to match the complexity of clinical
   reasoning and knowledge application. Future research should focus on
   addressing these challenges through ongoing research, optimizing
   generative AI models for medical content, exploring best practices for
   ethical AI usage, curriculum integration and evaluating the long-term
   impact of these technologies on learning outcomes. By expanding AI's
   knowledge base, refining its ability to interpret clinical images, and
   ensuring reliable, unbiased outputs, generative AI holds the potential
   to revolutionize orthopedic education. This work aims to provides a
   framework for incorporating generative AI into orthopedic curricula to
   create a more effective, engaging, and adaptive learning environment for
   future orthopedic practitioners.},

   way we live and work. Following several decades of artificial narrow
   intelligence, Generative AI is signaling a paradigm shift in the
   intelligence of machines, an increased generalization capability with
   increased accessibility and equity for nontechnical users. Large
   language models (LLMs) are leading this charge, specifically
   conversational interfaces, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama
   (large language model meta AI). Besides language and text, robust and
   effective Generative AI models have emerged for all other modalities of
   digital data, image, video, audio, code, and combinations thereof. This
   article presents the opportunities and challenges of Generative AI in
   advancing industrial systems and technologies. The article begins with
   an introduction to Generative AI, which includes its rapid progression
   to state-of-the-art, the deep learning algorithms, large training
   datasets, and computing infrastructure used to build Generative AI
   models, as well as the technical limitations. The contribution, value,
   and utility of Generative AI is presented in terms of its four
   capabilities of accelerating academic research, augmenting the learning
   and teaching experience, supporting industry practice, and increasing
   social impact. The article concludes with an expeditious message to the
   academic research and industry practitioner communities to invest time
   and effort in the training, adoption, and application of Generative AI,
   with consideration for AI literacy for all stakeholders,
   human-centricity, and the responsible development and use of AI in
   industrial settings.},

   understanding and to attain literacy. This paper brings together
   existing contributions to identify a list of five common themes (5Ts)
   and various uses of generative AI for improving students learning and
   future education research. The challenges and opportunities from the use
   of generative AI in education were also explored, and as part of a
   rethink of how stakeholders can continue to be relevant in a dynamic
   learning environment with emerging technologies, three ``R{''}
   guidelines (3Rs) are also proposed to aid educators and students to stay
   ahead of the curve in addressing challenges and embracing opportunities

Abstract = {Therapeutic resistance is a major challenge facing the design of
   effective cancer treatments. Adaptive cancer therapy is in principle the
   most viable approach to manage cancer's adaptive dynamics through drug
   combinations with dose timing and modulation. However, there are
   numerous open issues facing the clinical success of adaptive therapy.
   Chief among these issues is the feasibility of real-time predictions of
   treatment response which represent a bedrock requirement of adaptive
   therapy. Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to learn
   prediction models of treatment response from clinical, molecular, and
   radiomics data about patients and their treatments. The article explores
   this potential through a proposed integration model of Generative
   Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs) in a closed loop with adaptive
   treatments to predict the trajectories of disease progression. The
   conceptual model and the challenges facing its realization are discussed
   in the broader context of artificial intelligence integration in

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT
   has sparked significant assessment concerns within tertiary education.
   Assessment concerns have largely revolved around academic integrity
   issues among students, such as plagiarism and cheating. Nonetheless, it
   is also critical to consider that generative AI models trained on
   information retrieved from the Internet could produce biased and
   discriminatory outputs, and hallucination issues in large language
   models upon which generative AI acts provide made-up and untruthful
   outputs. This article considers the affordances and challenges of
   generative AI specific to assessments within tertiary education. It
   illustrates considerations for assessment redesign with the existence of
   generative AI and proposes the Against, Avoid and Adopt (AAA) principle
   to rethink and redesign assessments. It argues that more generative AI
   tools will emerge exponentially, and hence, engaging in an arms race
   against generative AI and policing the use of these technologies may not
   address the fundamental issues in assessments.},

Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence foundation models (for example
   Generative Pre-trained Transformer - GPT - models) can generate the next
   token given a sequence of tokens. How can this `generative AI' be
   compared with the `real' intelligence of the human brain, when for
   example a human generates a whole memory in response to an incomplete
   retrieval cue, and then generates further prospective thoughts? Here
   these two types of generative intelligence, artificial in machines and
   real in the human brain are compared, and it is shown how when whole
   memories are generated by hippocampal recall in response to an
   incomplete retrieval cue, what the human brain computes, and how it
   computes it, are very different from generative AI. Key differences are
   the use of local associative learning rules in the hippocampal memory
   system, and of non-local backpropagation of error learning in AI.
   Indeed, it is argued that the whole operation of the human brain is
   performed computationally very differently to what is implemented in
   generative AI. Moreover, it is emphasized that the primate including
   human hippocampal system includes computations about spatial view and
   where objects and people are in scenes, whereas in rodents the emphasis
   is on place cells and path integration by movements between places. This
   comparison with generative memory and processing in the human brain has
   interesting implications for the further development of generative AI
   and for neuroscience research.},

Volume = {40},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence, such as large
   language models and text-to-image models, has had a profound impact on
   society. The ability of these systems to simulate human capabilities
   such as text writing and image creation is radically redefining a wide
   range of practices, from artistic production to education. While there
   is no doubt that these innovations are beneficial to our lives, the
   pervasiveness of these technologies should not be underestimated, and
   raising increasingly pressing ethical questions that require a radical
   resemantization of certain notions traditionally ascribed to humans
   alone. Among these notions, that of technological intentionality plays a
   central role. With regard to this notion, this paper first aims to
   highlight what we propose to define in terms of the intentionality gap,
   whereby, insofar as, currently, (1) it is increasingly difficult to
   assign responsibility for the actions performed by AI systems to humans,
   as these systems are increasingly autonomous, and (2) it is increasingly
   complex to reconstruct the reasoning behind the results they produce as
   we move away from good old fashioned AI; it is now even more difficult
   to trace the intentionality of AI systems back to the intentions of the
   developers and end users. This gap between human and technological
   intentionality requires a revision of the concept of intentionality; to
   this end, we propose here to assign preter-intentional behavior to
   generative AI. We use this term to highlight how AI intentionality both
   incorporates and transcends human intentionality; i.e., it goes beyond
   (preter) human intentionality while being linked to it. To show the
   merits of this notion, we first rule out the possibility that such
   preter-intentionality is merely an unintended consequence and then
   explore its nature by comparing it with some paradigmatic notions of
   technological intentionality present in the wider debate on the moral
   (and technological) status of AI.},

   bibliometrics, text analysis, and social network analysis. Specifically,
   research themes and their relationships, the evolution of research
   themes over time, and prominent authors, articles, journals,
   institutions, and countries publishing in generative AI are identified.
   The data was further found to partially support the classical
   bibliometrics laws of Zipf, and Bradford's. The two overarching research
   themes identified using knowledge synthesis from most cited articles and
   journals are technical advancements and developments in generative AI
   systems; and their applications to image processing, pattern

Abstract = {This article examines the impact of utilizing generative artificial
   intelligence optimizations in automating the content generation process.
   This instance involves the identification of fraudulent content, which
   is often characterized by dynamic patterns, in addition to content
   production. The generated contents are constrained, which limits their
   dimensionality. In this scenario, duplicated contents are eliminated
   from the automatic creations. Furthermore, the generated ratios are
   utilized to discover current patterns with minimized losses and errors,
   hence enhancing the accuracy of generative contents. Furthermore, while
   analysing the created patterns, we detect a significant discrepancy in
   lead durations, resulting in the generation of high scores for relevant
   information. In order to test the results using generative tools, the
   adversarial network codes are employed in four scenarios. These
   scenarios involve generating large patterns and reducing the dynamic
   patterns with an enhanced accuracy of 97\% in the projected model. This
   is in contrast to the existing approach, which only provides a content
   accuracy of 77\% after detecting fraud.},

   problematic. However, generative AI has the potential to develop
   efficient, accurate, creative, and accessible word clouds. Three
   different methods representing three major approaches of word cloud
   generation were developed, implemented, and user evaluated-traditional
   (baseline), semantic (natural language processing enhanced), and
   generative AI (generative pretrained transformer based)-in two different
   language contexts-Chinese (China case) and English (Singapore case). The
   findings of the study show the technical robustness of the methods, as
   well as provide key pedagogical insights from the user perspective of
   instructors of higher education courses in China and Singapore.
   Implications to the design of word clouds and their application in
   teaching and learning are discussed.},

Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) is a burgeoning subfield of
   artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content which is
   poised to revolutionise different industries by 2028. This study aims
   first to identify key enablers for the successful integration of Gen-AI
   into the supply chain with the help of Delphi and AHP techniques. Then,
   we screened these enablers categories and identified seven key enabler
   categories using the Delphi method. We computed the weights of those
   categories and ranked them on the basis of their weights with Ethical
   and Fair AI Practices and Public Trust and Societal Impact among the
   most significant. Second, this study categorised the tweet into
   positive, neutral, and negative sentiments using sentiment analysis and
   identified fifteen topics from secondary data. The research concludes
   with actionable strategies for practitioners and outlines the
   significance of ethical and trust-related enablers in the adoption of

Title = {The revolution of generative artificial intelligence in psychology: The
   interweaving of behavior, consciousness, and ethics},
Journal = {ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {251},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent years, there have been unparalleled prospects for
   psychological study due to the swift advancement of generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) in natural language processing, shown by
   ChatGPT. This review article looks into the uses and effects of
   generative artificial intelligence in psychology. We employed a
   systematic selection process, encompassing papers published between 2015
   and 2024 from databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore,
   using keywords like ``Generative AI in psychology{''} ``ChatGPT and
   behavior modeling{''} and ``AI in mental health{''}. First, the paper
   goes over the fundamental ideas of generative AI and lists its uses in
   data analysis, behavior modeling, and social interaction simulation. A
   detailed comparison table has been added to contrast conventional
   research methodologies with GenAI-based approaches in psychology
   studies. Next, analyzing the theoretical and ethical issues that
   generative AI raises for psychological research, it highlights how
   crucial it is to develop a coherent theoretical framework. This study
   illustrates the benefits of generative AI in handling vast amounts of
   data and increasing research efficiency by contrasting traditional
   research methods with AI-driven methodologies. Regarding particular
   uses, the study explores how generative AI might be used to simulate
   social interactions, analyze massive amounts of text, and learn about
   cognitive processes. Section 5 has been expanded to include discussions
   on political biases, geographic biases, and other biases. In conclusion,
   the paper looks forward to the future development of generative AI in
   psychology research and suggests techniques for improving it. We have
   included methodological solutions such as the Retrieval Augmented
   Generation (RAG) approach and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as data
   privacy solutions like open-source local LLMs. In summary, generative AI
   has the potential to revolutionize psychological research, but in order
   to maintain the moral and scientific integrity of the field, ethical and
   theoretical concerns must be carefully considered before applying the
   technology.},

   conducted two sub-studies aimed at exploring the influences and
   differences in college students' attitudes towards generative artificial
   intelligence across the dimensions of gender, major, and experience. The
   first sub-study developed a scale based on the Expectancy-Value Theory
   to measure college students' attitudes towards generative artificial
   intelligence, confirming the scale's validity and reliability. The
   second sub-study analyzed attitudes towards generative artificial
   intelligence among 713 undergraduate students. The results revealed
   significant differences in undergraduate students' attitudes towards
   generative artificial intelligence based on gender, major, and
   experience. Female students and those with experience in generative
   artificial intelligence showed more positive attitudes compared to male
   students and those without generative artificial intelligence
   experience. Notably, students majoring in Education scored significantly
   higher on generative artificial intelligence attitudes than students
   from other majors. Regression analysis further indicated that gender,
   discipline, and experience significantly predicted attitudes towards
   generative artificial intelligence. Students from different academic
   backgrounds exhibited significant gender and experience differences in
   their attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence within their
   respective majors. These findings underscore the necessity for
   educational strategies that consider gender, experience, and
   disciplinary backgrounds. It is crucial to provide all students with
   ample opportunities to engage with generative artificial intelligence to
   ensure gender equity in artificial intelligence education. Educators
   must design differentiated and inclusive generative artificial

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 1},
Abstract = {The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technologies
   has sparked widespread interest, yet understanding of user adoption
   patterns for these tools remains limited. While the unified theory of
   acceptance and use of technology model has been widely applied to
   various technologies, its applicability to generative artificial
   intelligence products, which present unique challenges and
   opportunities, has not been thoroughly explored. This gap in knowledge
   hinders the development of effective strategies for promoting user
   acceptance and optimising the design of generative artificial
   intelligence tools. This study extends the unified theory of acceptance
   and use of technology model to investigate the factors influencing usage
   intention for generative artificial intelligence products. The study
   incorporates additional variables such as digital literacy, perceived
   risk and perceived trust to provide a more comprehensive framework.
   Using structural equation modelling to analyse survey data, the study
   found that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence,
   and perceived trust significantly and positively impact usage intention.
   In addition, digital literacy indirectly enhances usage intention
   through effort expectancy, while perceived risk negatively influences
   usage intention through reduced trust. Notably, facilitating conditions
   did not exhibit a significant effect on usage intention. These findings
   offer valuable insights for developers and researchers in the field of
   generative artificial intelligence, highlighting the importance of
   user-friendly design, performance optimisation, and trust-building
   measures. By identifying key factors that drive user adoption, this
   study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of technology
   acceptance in the context of advanced artificial intelligence systems,
   paving the way for more effective development and implementation
   strategies in this rapidly evolving field.},

   for this paper is to develop a better understanding of the range of
   possible impacts of ChatGPT on IS education and to describe how IS
   educators might respond to these potential impacts. To that end, we
   discuss challenges for IS education brought on by generative AI tools,
   and discuss potential future scenarios based on the emergence of such
   tools, ranging from AI having little impact on IS education to AI

Abstract = {Since 30 November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT, generative
   artificial intelligence has emerged as a subject of growing prominence.
   Various academic divisions, including academic librarianship, are
   closely monitoring the potential impact of generative artificial
   intelligence on their respective futures. Esteemed librarian
   associations such as the Council on East Asian Libraries have actively
   utilized industry-wide conventions to foster scholarly conversations,
   discussions, and debates regarding the influence of generative
   artificial intelligence on librarianship. This project draws inspiration
   from such discourse and is conducted by four Chinese and East Asian
   studies librarians from four prestigious American universities. Based on
   extensive first-hand experiments, they conclude that amidst the
   opportunities and challenges presented by generative artificial
   intelligence, the specialized expertise and knowledge possessed by area
   studies specialists is increasingly significant in shaping its
   implications for their field.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study reviews the recent progress of generative artificial
   intelligence for gastrointestinal disease (GID) from detection to
   diagnosis. The source of data was 16 original studies in PubMed. The
   search terms were ((gastro{*} {[}title]) or (endo{*} {[}title])) and
   ((GAN {[}title/abstract] or (transformer {[}title/abstract]). The
   eligibility criteria were as follows: (1) the dependent variable of
   gastrointestinal disease; (2) the interventions of generative
   adversarial network (GAN) and/or transformer for classification,
   detection and/or segmentation; (3) the outcomes of accuracy,
   intersection of union (IOU), structural similarity and/or Dice; (3) the
   publication period of 2021-2023; (4) the publication language of
   English. Based on the results of this study, different generative
   artificial intelligence methods would be appropriate for different tasks
   for the early diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease. For example, patch
   GAN (accuracy 91.9\%) in the case of classification, bi-directional
   cycle GAN (structural similarity 98.8\%) in the case of data generation
   and semi-supervised GAN (Dice 89.4\%) in the case of segmentation. Their
   performance indicators reported varied within 87.1-91.9\% for accuracy,
   83.0-98.8\% for structural similarity and 86.6-89.4\% for Dice.
   Likewise, vision transformer (accuracy 96.9\%) in the case of
   classification, multi-modal transformer (IOU 79.5\%) in the case of
   detection and multi-modal transformer (Dice 89.5\%) in the case of
   segmentation. Their performance measures reported registered a variation
   within 85.7-96.9\% for accuracy, 79.5\% for IOU and 77.8-89.5\% for
   Dice. Synthesizing different kinds of generative artificial intelligence
   for different kinds of GID data would further the horizon of research on
   this topic. In conclusion, however, generative artificial intelligence
   provides an effective, non-invasive decision support system for the
   early diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease from detection to diagnosis.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe principle of transparency is of great significance in the
   governance of text-based generative artificial intelligence (AI)
   technology. The principle of transparency not only requires the
   operational principles and algorithms of text-based generative
   artificial intelligence to be interpretable, but also requires
   text-based generative artificial intelligence programs to fulfill basic
   prompting obligations to users, especially when it comes to the output
   content of generative artificial intelligence, which cannot guarantee
   true and accurate prompts.AimsThe purpose of this study is to explore
   the classification and frequency of prompt methods in text-based
   generative artificial intelligence and to propose that laws should
   require different prompt rules for various user categories, addressing
   the current gap in existing regulations.MethodsThe experiment is
   conducted from June 1 to 15, 2024 in the school, scientific research
   company, media organization hall, and railway station lounge, and Kimi
   program, Tongyi program, ERNIE Bot program, iFLYTEK Spark program, etc.,
   are used as text-based generative AI programs.DiscussionThe results show
   that users aged 8-17 who are minors only have 6 points in their
   perception of the authenticity of the output content of generative
   artificial intelligence programs; the level of awareness of possible
   falsity during use reaches 4 points; the degree of user misleading is as
   high as 13 points.ConclusionThe study concludes that, for individuals
   needing special protection, such as minors, prompts should accompany
   every instance of content generation. For other user groups, prompts
   should be issued when necessary. To enhance prompt effectiveness, the
   program should display permanent prompts in prominent positions on the
   interface, using noticeable fonts and clear, well-designed wording.
   Research reveals that minors have insufficient perception of the
   authenticity of the output content of generative artificial
   intelligence, and the risk of misleading is significant, highlighting
   the importance of clear prompts for this specific group every time they
   generate content.},

Abstract = {Social work scholars have long questioned the validity and utility of
   the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB) licensing exams. Data
   released in 2022 revealed severe disparities in pass rates based on
   race, age, and language, exacerbating these concerns. In this paper, we
   explore the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as
   ChatGPT to address core problems of the ASWB exams, including the use of
   a multiple-choice format that does not reflect real-world social work
   practice. To assess its social work reasoning, we used ChatGPT to answer
   ASWB-developed practice questions for the Bachelors, Masters, and
   Clinical exams. ChatGPT scored 76\%, 80\%, and 64\%, respectively, and
   identified additional validity challenges. Based on this performance, we
   provide a proof-of-concept for how generative AI might move us toward a
   more valid and equitable exam. While we strongly support licensure
   requirements, state regulators and legislators should temporarily
   suspend the use of the ASWB exams for this purpose.},

   important scientific breakthroughs. Progress in AI slowed, however, due
   to limitations in computing, analytics, and data. The landscape around
   these challenges has significantly evolved in the last 70 years,
   ushering in a new wave of opportunities. Among the opportunities are 2
   AI technologies you will see in nursing practice, predictive AI and
   generative AI. Predictive AI uses data, such as patient data, to make
   predictions about future events or trends. Generative AI learns patterns
   in existing data and generates new data based on those patterns to
   create original content. This column of Technology Today column compares
   how these 2 AI technologies work and provides cases to illustrate how
   each may be employed to improve patient outcomes and advance nursing

Abstract = {This study examines key reasons (for and against) that influence
   business-to-business (B2B) managers' intention to adopt generative
   artificial intelligence (GenAI). We also investigate how GenAI adoption
   influences firm performance, along with the moderating effect of ethical
   leadership. Study 1 undertakes a series of in-depth interviews, yielding
   a set of hypotheses that are tested in Study 2. A total of 277 responses
   was collected from respondents in the USA, the UK, Canada, India,
   Australia, Malaysia, and Japan to test the proposed model using
   structural equation modeling. The findings highlight that need for
   uniqueness, information completeness, convenience, and deceptiveness
   significantly impact GenAI adoption. The results also highlight that
   GenAI adoption boosts firm performance. Finally, ethical leadership was
   found to moderate the effect of GenAI adoption on firm performance. This
   study enriches the GenAI, technology adoption, and behavioral reasoning
   theory literatures while also providing pertinent insights for firms
   intending to adopt GenAI.},

Abstract = {As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as
   ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the
   social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will
   be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it
   is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which
   constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW)
   hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking
   metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy.
   There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence:
   a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The
   combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works
   by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from
   information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The
   parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning
   (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by
   analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the
   data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal
   development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative
   framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD
   generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as
   not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.},

Abstract = {Molecular generative artificial intelligence is
   drawingsignificantattention in the drug design community, with several
   experimentallyvalidated proof of concepts already published.
   Nevertheless, generativemodels are known for sometimes generating
   unrealistic, unstable, unsynthesizable,or uninteresting structures. This
   calls for methods to constrain thosealgorithms to generate structures in
   drug-like portions of the chemicalspace. While the concept of
   applicability domains for predictive modelsis well studied, its
   counterpart for generative models is not yetwell-defined. In this work,
   we empirically examine various possibilitiesand propose applicability
   domains suited for generative models. Usingboth public and internal data
   sets, we use generative methods to generatenovel structures that are
   predicted to be actives by a correspondingquantitative
   structure-activity relationships model while constrainingthe generative
   model to stay within a given applicability domain.Our work looks at
   several applicability domain definitions, combiningvarious criteria,
   such as structural similarity to the training set,similarity of
   physicochemical properties, unwanted substructures,and quantitative
   estimate of drug-likeness. We assess the structuresgenerated from both
   qualitative and quantitative points of view andfind that the
   applicability domain definitions have a strong influenceon the
   drug-likeness of generated molecules. An extensive analysisof our
   results allows us to identify applicability domain definitionsthat are
   best suited for generating drug-like molecules with generativemodels. We
   anticipate that this work will help foster the adoptionof generative
   models in an industrial context.},

   CORPORATE IDENTITY ELEMENTS},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {98},
Number = {6},
Pages = {212-230},
Abstract = {The emergence of new tools, the appearance of new technologies and
   improvements to existing ones have resulted in expansion of generative
   artificial intelligence. The technologies of generative artificial
   intelligence have already been used by people to perform not only
   intellectual tasks, but also creative ones, in particular in the field
   of design. Therefore, their capabilities in graphic design need to be
   studied. One of the routine tasks of a designer is the development of
   corporate identity elements (a logo, font, and colour). Designers can
   spend a lot of time on this, choosing different style options.
   Therefore, delegating this routine work to generative artificial
   intelligence may be appropriate. With this practical need in mind, the
   capabilities of modern AI tools for image and logo generation were
   studied in the research, and the results of AI logo generation compared
   to the work of novice designers were analysed. As a result, conclusions
   were drawn about the expediency of using generative AI technology in the
   work of designers, in particular, for the development of corporate
   identity elements, and the appropriateness of studying generative
   artificial intelligence technology in the training of future designers.
   These conclusions were made on the basis of a survey of 41 experts in
   the field of design, information technology and artificial intelligence.
   Based on the findings of the survey, we can note that it was difficult
   for experts to distinguish between logos generated by artificial
   intelligence and logos created by novice designers. Logos developed by
   novice designers (5) were recognized as the most attractive among the 45
   logos presented in the survey. Images generated in some AI tools (Tailor
   Brands, Hatchful) are considered attractive by design, information
   technology and artificial intelligence professionals. Therefore, they
   can be used to create corporate identity elements. Thus, the vast
   majority of experts agreed that artificial intelligence tools for
   generating images and logos should be used in the process of creating
   corporate identity elements. In addition, the vast majority of experts
   found it advisable to use generative artificial intelligence
   technologies in the process of professional training of future
   designers.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)

   Drawing on the resource-based view, we employed a mixed-methods

   (PLS-SEM), importance-performance map analysis (IPMA), fuzzy-set
   qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), and semi-structured interviews

   thinking. Secondly, we cut out the different scales at which AI is
   currently developed: the micro scale, the meso scale (the most suitable
   for situating public policies) and the macro scale. Thirdly, we present
   two transversal approaches to addressing AI: the legal one, oriented
   towards responsibility, and the systemic one, oriented towards
   protection and security.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has recently achieved
   significant success, enabling anyone to create texts, images, videos and
   even computer codes while providing insights that might not be possible
   with traditional tools. To stimulate future research, this work provides
   a brief summary of the ongoing and historical developments in GAI over
   the past 70 years. The achievements are grouped into four categories:
   (i) rule-based generative systems that follow specialized rules and
   instructions, (ii) model-based generative algorithms that produce new
   content based on statistical or graphical models, (iii) deep generative
   methodologies that utilize deep neural networks to learn how to generate
   new content from data and (iv) foundation models that are trained on
   extensive datasets and capable of performing a variety of generative
   tasks. This paper also reviews successful generative applications and
   identifies open challenges posed by remaining issues. In addition, this
   paper describes potential research directions aimed at better utilizing,
   understanding and harnessing GAI technologies.
   This paper reviews the historical milestones, successful applications,
   and remaining challenges in generative artificial intelligence over the
   past seven decades.},

Title = {Generative artificial intelligence use in evidence synthesis: A
   systematic review},
Journal = {RESEARCH SYNTHESIS METHODS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 24},
Abstract = {Introduction With the increasing accessibility of tools such as ChatGPT,
   Copilot, DeepSeek, Dall-E, and Gemini, generative artificial
   intelligence (GenAI) has been poised as a potential, research timesaving
   tool, especially for synthesising evidence. Our objective was to
   determine whether GenAI can assist with evidence synthesis by assessing
   its performance using its accuracy, error rates, and time savings
   compared to the traditional expert-driven approach.Methods To
   systematically review the evidence, we searched five databases on 17
   January 2025, synthesised outcomes reporting on the accuracy, error
   rates, or time taken, and appraised the risk-of-bias using a modified
   version of QUADAS-2.Results We identified 3,071 unique records, 19 of
   which were included in our review. Most studies had a high or unclear
   risk-of-bias in Domain 1A: review selection, Domain 2A: GenAI conduct,
   and Domain 1B: applicability of results. When used for (1) searching
   GenAI missed 68\% to 96\% (median = 91\%) of studies, (2) screening made
   incorrect inclusion decisions ranging from 0\% to 29\% (median = 10\%);
   and incorrect exclusion decisions ranging from 1\% to 83\% (median =
   28\%), (3) incorrect data extractions ranging from 4\% to 31\% (median =
   14\%), (4) incorrect risk-of-bias assessments ranging from 10\% to 56\%
   (median = 27\%).Conclusion Our review shows that the current evidence
   does not support GenAI use in evidence synthesis without human
   involvement or oversight. However, for most tasks other than searching,
   GenAI may have a role in assisting humans with evidence synthesis.},

Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {While generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for many
   years, it has only recently become available for use by the public. This
   powerful resource has changed the landscape for higher education and
   many instructors fear the negative effects it can have on academic
   integrity and student creativity in the writing process. However, it is
   certain that AI is here to stay, and it is crucial that educators
   embrace this technology and teach students to use this resource
   carefully and wisely. Communication is an essential component in nursing
   practice and cultivating competent writing skills is a vital aspect of
   nursing education. However, nursing students struggle with scholarly
   writing especially at the undergraduate level. Integrating generative
   artificial intelligence into a writing intensive course offers a unique
   approach to aid students in improving their writing. In this pilot
   project, students were given an assignment to actively engage with
   generative artificial intelligence and critically analyze the response
   using current nursing literature to support or refute the output. This
   assignment was used to springboard class discussion on advantages and
   disadvantages of using artificial intelligence for scholarly writing.
   This novel approach has the potential to build confidence and competence

Journal = {CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {43},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As technology continues to transform education, the adoption of
   generative artificial intelligence is increasing in nursing education.
   However, concerns regarding the accuracy of AI-generated content and
   ethical issues exist. This study explores the perceptions/experiences of
   nurse educators in South Korea regarding the use of generative
   artificial intelligence. Using a cross-sectional survey, data were
   gathered from 120 nurse educators, and descriptive statistical analysis
   was applied to the data. Significantly 38.9\% of participants reported
   no prior engagement with generative artificial intelligence. Meanwhile,
   32.5\% identified ChatGPT as their preferred source. The perceived
   usefulness of generative artificial intelligence was evaluated on
   average as 3.11 (SD = 0.31) on a 4-point scale, suggesting a generally
   favorable view of its potential to diversify learning resources, enhance
   student learning experiences, and improve educational quality. Despite
   these positive perceptions, the average engagement score with generative
   artificial intelligence was 2.76 (SD = 0.40), reflecting moderate actual
   use. This study contributes to the literature on generative artificial
   intelligence integration in education, revealing an overall positive
   attitude among nurse educators. It underscores the need for increased
   application and familiarity with such technologies to maximize teaching
   strategy benefits, student outcomes, and the efficacy of nursing
   education.},

Title = {Generative Artificial Intelligence and Extended Cognition in Science
   Learning Contexts},
Journal = {SCIENCE \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUN 11},
Abstract = {This paper philosophically examines the impact of generative artificial
   intelligence on learning processes from the perspective of extended
   cognition. The central problem addressed is how these technologies can
   transform students into passive or active learners, influencing the
   development of cognitive skills. It will be argued that generative
   artificial intelligence presents risks of diminishing cognitive activity
   among students, as it is likely to substitute-rather than complement-the
   cognitive subject. It will also be argued that there are ways to
   leverage generative artificial intelligence so that learners are not
   passive but rather active cognitive subjects. Three cases will be
   presented, with empirical support, to show how this leveraging is
   possible: the production of feedback, assistive technologies, and
   gamification. In these cases, generative artificial intelligence is a
   complementary cognitive artifact rather than a substitutive one. To
   achieve this goal, the paper presents the framework of the extended mind
   thesis as a conducive scenario for analyzing the relationship between
   generative artificial intelligence and learning contexts, and it
   analyzes specific cases of science education. An analysis of the types
   of cognitive artifacts will also be conducted to examine how generative
   artificial intelligence intervenes in learning in both substitute and
   complementary ways.},

Abstract = {The current study investigates how faculty members in Chinese
   universities are navigating the integration of generative artificial
   intelligence tools into second language curricula, focusing on specific
   pedagogical and institutional challenges. Using an exploratory
   sequential mixed-method approach (N = 776), we examined how faculty
   perceive and address key areas of concern: curriculum adaptation,
   assessment transformation, student engagement, ethical concerns,
   professional development needs, and pedagogical shifts. Unlike prior
   studies, which often generalize faculty experiences, this study uniquely
   captures nuanced faculty strategies and gaps in readiness across a
   large-scale context in Chinese higher education. Results indicated that
   faculty members exhibited significant usage of generative artificial
   intelligence tools both for personal and professional purposes. They
   also used generative artificial intelligence tools for formative
   assessment practices, with limited application in summative assessments.
   Results indicated faculty faced Generative AI tool usage challenges like
   curriculum adaptation, assessment transformation, student engagement
   with generative artificial intelligence tools, ethical concerns,
   professional development, and pedagogical shifts. The findings also
   demonstrated that faculty members were struggling to address these
   challenges. Furthermore, outcomes indicated that professional
   development and ethical concerns directly, indirectly, positively and
   significantly contribute to helping faculty to enhance student
   engagement and pedagogical shifts in their teaching practices.
   Additionally, curriculum adaptation and assessment transformation have
   also mediated these relationships. These findings contribute novel
   insights into how professional development can support effective GenAI
   integration. Implications are offered for faculty development programs,
   curriculum design policies, and institutional governance in the era of
   AI-enhanced education.},

Abstract = {University students are increasingly using generative artificial

   was conducted among 308 students from 66 collaborative groups, and the
   collected questionnaire data were analyzed through partial least squares
   structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results of this study
   indicate that the perceived intelligence of generative AI can indirectly
   promote team creativity through collective efficacy and suppress team
   creativity through task conflict. Furthermore, team trust strengthens
   the relationship between the perceived intelligence of generative AI and
   collective efficacy such that it also strengthens the indirect
   relationship between the perceived intelligence of generative AI and
   team creativity through collective efficacy. The results of this study
   have crucial theoretical implications as well as vital practical
   implications for designers of educational generative AI tools.},

Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {This study examines how generative AI (GAI) impacts primary students'
   in-depth learning, focusing on critical thinking and prior knowledge. A
   quasi-experiment involved 163 sixth-graders divided into three groups: a
   control group (lecture-based instruction) and two experimental groups
   using GAI as a cognitive tool (materials generation) or thinking tool
   (critical analysis), in which 126 participants successfully completed
   all the tests and were included in the analysis. ANOVA revealed the
   thinking-tool group and cognitive-tool group both outperformed the
   control group in in-depth learning, which was reflected by the knowledge
   transfer. Hierarchical regression showed students' critical thinking
   skills and use of generative artificial intelligence significantly
   contributed to their in-depth learning, while prior knowledge did not.
   Further analysis found that significant interaction effects existed
   between the use of generative artificial intelligence and critical
   thinking skills, while no significant interaction was found between the
   use of generative artificial intelligence and students' prior knowledge.
   In sum, critical thinking amplified GAI's impact, while prior knowledge
   showed no interaction. The results suggest GAI enhances deep learning
   when integrated with critical thinking, reducing reliance on prior
   knowledge. Educators should prioritize fostering critical thinking to
   maximize GAI's benefits. The findings underscore the need for
   pedagogical designs that balance GAI's cognitive support with

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is emerging as a

   and post-tests of knowledge and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI)
   were applied to evaluate learning, intrinsic motivation, and the

   diverse engineering disciplines and regions across China used generative
   AI, focusing on its impact on their learning experience and the
   opportunities and challenges it poses in engineering education. Based on
   the surveyed data, we explored four key areas: the frequency and

   on students' learning and performance, commonly encountered challenges
   in using generative AI, and future prospects for its adoption in
   engineering education. The results showed that more than half of the

   learning efficiency, initiative, and creativity, with nearly half
   believing it also enhanced their independent thinking. However, despite
   acknowledging improved study efficiency, many felt their actual academic
   performance remained largely unchanged and expressed concerns about the
   accuracy and domain-specific reliability of generative AI. Our findings
   provide a first-hand insight into the current benefits and challenges

Abstract = {This article explores the use of generative artificial intelligence in
   Latin American university libraries, discussing both its potential
   benefits and challenges. It emphasizes how generative artificial
   intelligence, which is capable of generating text, video, images, music,
   and code, is revolutionizing library operations by automating tasks and
   enhancing research and reference services. The research involved a
   literature review and interviews with library directors from six
   prominent universities, revealing varied levels of generative artificial
   intelligence adoption, from experimental to fully integrated within
   institutional frameworks. The challenges include staff resistance,
   training deficiencies, and technological constraints. The study is
   optimistic about the future of generative artificial intelligence in
   academic libraries, recommending ongoing training and clear policy
   development for its successful and ethical implementation. Major service
   providers like EBSCO, Clarivate, and Elsevier are also noted for their
   role in supporting this digital transition.},

   Translation of Early Vulnerability Cybersecurity Alerts},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Month = {APR 8},
Abstract = {The increasing reliance on artificial intelligence in cybersecurity has
   broadened the role of generative artificial intelligence in tasks such
   as text generation and translation. This study assesses the
   effectiveness of generative artificial intelligence and conventional
   translation tools in translating early vulnerability alerts from English
   to Spanish-a critical process for ensuring the timely dissemination of
   cybersecurity information. Utilizing a dataset provided by the Spanish
   National Cybersecurity Institute, translations were generated using
   various systems and evaluated through linguistic assessment metrics,
   including methods measuring lexical similarity and others capturing
   semantic meaning beyond direct word matching. Additionally, word
   embeddings were employed to enhance the accuracy of semantic similarity
   analysis. The results indicate that conventional translation tools
   generally exhibit greater accuracy and structural fidelity, whereas
   generative artificial intelligence produces more natural-sounding
   translations. However, this flexibility results in greater variability
   in translation quality. The findings suggest that while generative
   artificial intelligence may serve as a valuable complement to
   traditional tools, its inconsistencies may limit its suitability for
   highly technical content that demands precision. This study underscores
   the importance of integrating both approaches to improve the accuracy
   and accessibility of cybersecurity alerts across different languages.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence has recently emerged as a
   transformative technology which is able to analyze vast datasets and
   generate valuable insights, particularly in supply chain management.
   Simultaneously, the proliferation of Internet of Behaviors which
   collects and analyzes data on human behaviors enables businesses to gain
   a deeper understanding of user preferences and habits. Despite the
   growing adoption of generative artificial intelligence and Internet of
   Behaviors, their interaction and combined impacts on supply chain
   management remain underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by
   examining how generative artificial intelligence and Internet of
   Behaviors can be leveraged to enhance business operations. To be
   specific, we first review the relevant literature to identify the key
   issues and challenges associated with generative artificial intelligence
   and Internet of Behaviors. We then discuss real-world applications to
   illustrate the practical value these technologies bring to businesses.
   Based on the collected literature and industry practices, we propose a
   framework for businesses to integrate generative artificial intelligence
   and Internet of Behaviors into their supply chain management. This
   framework highlights the significant opportunities for businesses to
   enhance their supply chain performance by adopting these advanced
   technologies. Finally, we build a future research agenda and draw our

Abstract = {Based on the person-affect-cognition-execution theory, this research
   examines how generative artificial intelligence anxiety and fear of

   the need for cognitive closure significantly positively moderates the
   relationship between fear of missing out and problematic ChatGPT use.
   This paper extends the literature on the existing effect of generative

Abstract = {Rapid urbanization is reshaping mobility demands, calling for advanced
   intelligence and management capabilities in urban transport systems.
   Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents new opportunities to
   enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of Intelligent Transportation
   Systems (ITS). This paper reviews the existing literature in
   transportation and AI to investigate the core technologies of Artificial
   Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)-including dialog and reasoning,
   prediction and decision making, and multimodal generation. Applications
   are summarized across the four primary ITS subsystems (road subsystem,
   vehicle subsystem, traveler subsystem and management subsystem). This
   paper finds that AIGC has become an important way to promote the
   progress and development of ITS by exploring the research progress of
   cutting-edge technologies such as data generation, assisted driving
   decision-making, and intelligent traffic prediction. Meanwhile, this
   paper explores the potential challenges that AIGC brings to human
   society from the perspectives of safety risks of fake content,
   human-machine relationships, social cognition and emotional trust, and
   related ethical issues, providing insights for the development of safer
   and more sustainable ITS in the future.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly driving a new
   phase of artificial intelligence revolution, marked by various
   applications such as ChatGPT, Sora and DeepSeek. With powerful
   capabilities in content generation, personalization and user
   interaction, GenAI can drive significant enhancements in various mobile
   services to satisfy individual user preferences. Meanwhile, mobile
   services offer substantial support for accessibility, functionality and
   intelligence of GenAI applications. However, current research on
   integrating GenAI and mobile services remains nascent, lacking necessary
   theoretical and technical support. In this survey, we break down a new
   vision to guide research on integrating GenAI and mobile services,
   aiming to improve 6G intelligence levels and enable 6G mobile networks
   to support the integration of GenAI and mobile services effectively. We
   begin by examining the necessity of integrating GenAI with 6G mobile
   services and exploring potential learning architectures of GenAI models
   within mobile networks. Next, we analyze potential solutions from two
   perspectives: how 6G mobile networks empower GenAI and how GenAI enables
   mobile services. We subsequently explore a promising use case, along
   with essential features and techniques, to facilitate the integration of
   GenAI and mobile services. Finally, we discuss future research
   directions, aiming at realizing intelligent 6G networks.},

Abstract = {Generative language models have witnessed substantial traction, notably
   with the introduction of refined models aimed at more coherent user-AI
   interactions-principally conversational models. The epitome of this
   public attention has arguably been the refinement of the GPT-3 model
   into ChatGPT and its subsequent integration with auxiliary capabilities
   such as search features in Microsoft Bing. Despite voluminous prior
   research devoted to its developmental trajectory, the model's
   performance, and applicability to a myriad of quotidian tasks remained
   nebulous and task specific. In terms of technological implementation,
   the advent of models such as LLMv2 and ChatGPT-4 has elevated the
   discourse beyond mere textual coherence to nuanced contextual
   understanding and real-world task completion. Concurrently, emerging
   architectures that focus on interpreting latent spaces have offered more
   granular control over text generation, thereby amplifying the model's
   applicability across various verticals. Within the purview of cyber
   defense, especially in the Swiss operational ecosystem, these models
   pose both unprecedented opportunities and challenges. Their capabilities
   in data analytics, intrusion detection, and even misinformation
   combatting is laudable; yet the ethical and security implications

   behavioral intention of using generative artificial intelligence
   (Generative AI): A network analysis},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {154},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Aim: This study aims to identify the most critical factors influencing
   nursing students' behavioral intention to use generative artificial
   intelligence by developing a network structure. Background: Generative
   artificial intelligence is increasingly integrated into nursing
   education and clinical nursing practice. Studies have explored the
   factors influencing behavioral intentions toward the use of Artificial
   Intelligence, but research specific to Generative Artificial
   Intelligence is still lacking. It's crucial for nursing students to use
   generative artificial intelligence effectively, especially as clinical
   environments change rapidly in the digital era. Thus, it is important to
   identify the key factors that influence their intention to use. Methods:
   A cross-sectional study was conducted. 800 participants were recruited
   from November to December 2023 through convenient sampling. Network
   analysis was applied in this study to identify the important nodes that
   are the most critical target goals for improving the behavioral
   intention of using Generative artificial intelligence by R package.
   Results: The network analysis indicated that Artificial Intelligence
   Relevance, Ethical Awareness About Artificial Intelligence served as
   central factors in the network of Generative Artificial Intelligence
   Intention of using (EI = 1.19, 1.06). Artificial Intelligence Literacy
   was a key bridge node linking the Generative Artificial Intelligence
   Intention of using with its influencing factor associations (BEI =
   0.33). Conclusions: Generative Artificial Intelligence Relevance,
   Ethical Awareness about Generative Artificial Intelligence and
   Generative Artificial Intelligence Literacy serves as potential targets
   for enhancing nursing students' behavioral intention. Nursing educators
   and universities could consider targeted and collaborative effort to
   improve their behavioral intention.},

   place within the scope of a 12-week arts major workshop course. Data
   were collected in semi-structured interviews and using reflective
   journals and analyzed using the inductive content analysis method. It
   was determined that the participants were initially prejudiced against
   generative artificial intelligence and inexperienced in using it, while
   these attitudes became more positive over time. The participants stated
   that generative artificial intelligence tools were a source of
   inspiration, offered support in composition development, and had a
   guiding role in terms of aesthetics and style. On the other hand, some
   participants reported that during the arts education process supported
   by artificial intelligence, they experienced challenges such as
   communication problems, lack of technical knowledge, and concerns about
   originality. The results of the study revealed that generative
   artificial intelligence could be utilized as an educational tool that

Title = {How generative artificial intelligence supported reflective strategies
   promote middle school students' conceptual knowledge learning: an
   empirical study from China},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUN 25},
Abstract = {Integrating generative artificial intelligence into the reflection
   process can promote the learning of conceptual knowledge. Therefore,
   this study proposed Generative Artificial Intelligence-Supported
   Reflective Strategies (GAI-RS) and explored its impact on students'
   conceptual knowledge learning. The participants were 83 middle school
   seventh-grade students (42 in the experimental group and 41 in the
   control group). The experimental group used Generative Artificial
   Intelligence-Supported Reflective Strategies (GAI-RS), and the control
   group used Traditional Teacher-Supported Reflective Strategies (TT-RS).
   The results showed that GAI-RS promoted students' conceptual knowledge
   learning, and the students in the experimental group had higher levels
   of reflective thinking and learning engagement. In addition, epistemic
   network analysis (ENA) revealed that the strategy was beneficial in
   optimizing students' cognitive network structure. All students in the
   experimental group showed high learning satisfaction with this strategy.
   In short, GAI-RS has significant effectiveness in promoting students'
   conceptual knowledge learning, reflective thinking and learning
   engagement, and provides new inspiration for research on instructional
   practices for integrating generative artificial intelligence in
   information science and technology courses.},

Title = {Development of the generative artificial intelligence awareness scale
   for secondary school students in Türkiye},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {184},

Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {The widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in
   education and daily life necessitates a deeper understanding of
   students' awareness and attitudes. However, there is a lack of
   appropriate and psychometrically validated tools to assess these
   constructs reliably. This study aimed to examine the validity and
   reliability of a newly developed scale measuring secondary school
   students' awareness of generative artificial intelligence in the Turkish
   context. This methodological study employed a cross-sectional,
   descriptive, and correlational design. The research was conducted with
   444 secondary school students aged 14-18. Data were collected using a
   Demographic Information Form and the Generative Artificial Intelligence
   Awareness Scale. The study followed a three-stage process in line with
   the STROBE checklist: (1) item development, (2) expert evaluation for
   content validity, and (3) construct validity and reliability testing.
   Construct validity was assessed using Exploratory and Confirmatory
   Factor Analyses. Reliability was examined through Cronbach's alpha,
   corrected item-total correlations, and split-half reliability analysis.
   EFA revealed a three-factor structure: Basic Knowledge of Generative
   Artificial Intelligence, Positive Attitudes Toward Generative Artificial
   Intelligence, and Concerns About the Impacts of Generative Artificial
   Intelligence, explaining 54.29\% of the total variance. CFA supported
   the model, yielding acceptable fit indices (chi 2/df = 3.792, RMSEA =
   0.056, GFI = 0.905, CFI = 0.927, TLI = 0.919), indicating good model
   fit. The Cronbach's alpha for the total scale was 0.946, with subscale
   coefficients ranging from 0.822 to 0.925. Corrected item-total
   correlations ranged from 0.512 to 0.733. Split-half reliability for the
   first factor showed strong consistency (Spearman-Brown = 0.891, Guttman
   = 0.887, correlation between halves = 0.804). The findings demonstrate
   that the Turkish version of the generative artificial
   intelligenceawareness scale is a valid and reliable instrument for
   assessing students' knowledge, attitudes, and concerns about generative
   AI. What is Known:center dot Generative artificial intelligence (GAI)

Abstract = {Aims and method Advances in generative artificial intelligence,
   particularly through large language models, like GPT-4, have opened
   opportunities to develop cognitive agents to enhance clinical
   productivity, especially in complex secondary and tertiary care
   settings. However, as artificial intelligence begins to occupy the
   cognitive space traditionally held by human clinical reasoning,
   transparency becomes a significant concern. Unlike human
   decision-making, artificial intelligence-generated outputs may not be
   traceable to a transparent chain of clinical reasoning, potentially
   impacting safety if used without adequate `clinician reach' into the
   reasoning space of artificial intelligence.Results We highlight the need
   for a consensus framework to guide the responsible use of generative
   artificial intelligence in mental healthcare, which, it is argued, has
   cognitive demands and features distinct from physical medicine. We
   propose such a framework, Clinical Reach into the Cognitive Space

   multi-model framework for manufacturing operations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 6},
Abstract = {Product conceptual design is paramount in targeting specific customer
   segments, elevating brand equity, and ultimately boosting revenue
   sources. In the era of digitalisation, Generative Artificial
   Intelligence (GAI) is emerging to advance this process. This study
   introduces a pioneering framework, namely Generative Artificial
   Intelligence Product Designer (GAI-PD), that harnesses the power of GAI
   to revolutionise the design generation process, fostering efficiency,
   creativity, and responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption.
   GAI-PD is a novel multi-model framework integrating Generative
   Adversarial Network (GAN) and Large Language Model (LLM) that empowers
   designers to leverage GAN's capabilities for realistic visual output and
   LLM's natural language interaction. A comprehensive case example
   demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, achieving 90.23\% accuracy
   in generating valid design concepts and showing that hyperparameter
   tuning can significantly enhance image quality. From a managerial
   perspective, the findings indicate that adopting the GAI-PD framework
   can substantially reduce product development cycle times and accelerate
   time-to-market, offering a distinct competitive advantage. The study
   also explores avenues for future research, such as using advanced GAI
   models for high-resolution design generation and automated design
   evaluation, ultimately paving the way for enhanced design processes in

Abstract = {The authors research the criminalistic aspects of risks associated with
   the emergence and spread of a new information technology, namely,
   generative artificial intelligence used to create various information
   products quickly and effectively. The assessments of this technology are
   controversial (especially in view of its potential diverse applications)
   due to a high public danger of its application in criminal activities or
   for military purposes. The authors examine the approaches of different
   researchers to using generative artificial intelligence to commit
   crimes, present their own position regarding the possible criminal law
   qualification of such actions, and describe possible directions of
   improving the legislation. The conducted research al- lowed the authors
   to conclude that the risks of damaging public relations protected by the
   law via the use of generative artificial intelligence are mainly
   associated with computer-mediated communication. It seems that this
   technology is most often used to commit crimes through deception and
   information manipulation, such as fraud, spread of disinformation,
   involvement into extremist (including terrorist) activities, etc. It is
   facilitated by the wide possibilities of using artificial intelligence
   to create various information products: text, audio- and
   video-recordings, images, software, etc. At the same time, the work of
   generative artificial intelligence involves a specific mechanism of
   trace formation and is manifested in the forensically (primarily - diag-
   nostically) relevant features. It is possible to establish these
   features through the use of criminalistic knowledge and means. It seems
   that the most relevant current source of the resources providing
   research support for the law enforcement work is a new special
   criminalistic theory - criminalistic speech science.},

Abstract = {This study investigates motivational transformations among advanced

   generative artificial intelligence (AI). Employing a narrative inquiry
   approach, it analyzes how learners' self-regulated strategies, identity,
   and linguistic awareness evolve through sustained interaction with AI.
   Despite differences in personal goals and usage patterns, all
   participants showed a common shift from passive, extrinsically motivated
   learners to autonomous, intrinsically driven language users. Generative
   AI functioned not merely as a corrective tool, but as a cognitive and
   affective mediator that enhanced learners' self-evaluation, expressive
   capacity, and emotional security. These findings suggest that generative
   AI can contribute to restructuring learners' motivational systems and
   identities beyond improving linguistic proficiency. (Seoul National

Abstract = {This editorial summarises the special issue entitled ``Theory and

   Generative artificial intelligence is a new technology that is not only
   known in professional circles but has also gained widespread recognition
   and popularity due to its easy accessibility and benefits for lay users.
   The high level of interest in this technology stems not only from
   current experience with it and its current usefulness, but also from the
   assumption that this new technology will significantly affect a wide
   range of industries, many types of jobs, and the everyday lives of many
   people in the future. That is why, in this special issue, we have
   focused not only on the purely technical aspects of GenAI, but also on
   the social and commercial aspects related, for example, to institutional
   innovation, as well as ethical aspects and philosophical perspectives.
   This special issue consists of seven articles.},

Title = {Generative Artificial Intelligence and Transversal Competencies in
   Higher Education: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {APPLIED SYSTEM INNOVATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {Generative AI is an emerging tool in higher education; however, its
   connection with transversal competencies, as well as their sustainable
   adoption, remains underexplored. The study aims to analyze the
   scientific and conceptual development of generative artificial
   intelligence in higher education to identify the most relevant
   transversal competencies, strategic processes for its sustainable
   implementation, and global trends in academic production. A systematic
   literature review (PRISMA) was conducted on the Web of Science, Scopus,
   and PubMed, analyzing 35 studies for narrative synthesis and 897
   publications for bibliometric analysis. The transversal competencies
   identified were: Academic Integrity, Critical Thinking, Innovation,
   Ethics, Creativity, Communication, Collaboration, AI Literacy,
   Responsibility, Digital Literacy, AI Ethics, Autonomous Learning,
   Self-Regulation, Flexibility, and Leadership. The conceptual framework
   connotes the interdisciplinary nature and five key processes were
   identified to achieve the sustainable integration of Generative AI in
   higher education oriented to the development of transversal
   competencies: (1) critical and ethical appropriation, (2) institutional
   management of technological infrastructure, (3) faculty development, (4)
   curricular transformation, and (5) pedagogical innovation. On
   bibliometric behavior, scientific articles predominate, with few
   systematic reviews. China leads in publication volume, and social
   sciences are the most prominent area. It is concluded that generative
   artificial intelligence is key to the development of transversal
   competencies if it is adopted from a critical, ethical, and
   pedagogically intentional approach. Its implications and future
   projections in the field of higher education are discussed.},

Abstract = {Introduction. The educational activities of students are currently
   undergoing significant chang-es due to the active integration of
   generative artificial intelligence into the learning process. The
   academic community is concerned that these technologies may not only
   diminish students' cognitive abilities but also undermine their role as
   active participants in educational activities. Consequently, it is
   important to develop a model of interaction between students and
   generative artificial intelligence that supports the preservation and
   enhancement of their agency. This approach will enable the management of
   the currently spontaneous interactions between students and neural
   networks, making the process purpose-ful, controlled, and focused on the
   personal development of students. Aim. The present study aimed to
   conduct a systematic analysis of scientific perspectives on student
   subjectivity and its interaction with generative artificial
   intelligence. Methodology and research methods. The aim was achieved
   through the following methods: analytical literature review and systems
   analysis. Results. It was established that the theoretical basis for
   developing a model of developmental interaction between students and
   genera-tive artificial intelligence comprised the fundamental
   characteristics of interaction as an interdiscipli-nary category,
   alongside the qualities of the subject related to autonomy, awareness,
   and the ability to self-regulate and self-organise activities.
   Scientific novelty. The interaction of students with generative
   artificial intelligence is regarded not only as a means to enhance
   educational outcomes but, above all, as an opportunity to develop the
   student's personal qualities. Practical significance. The materials
   presented in this article may be utilised by practitioners in the fields
   of pedagogy and educational psychology to de-velop programmes for the
   psychological and pedagogical support of students. Furthermore, a
   theoretical review and systematic analysis of the scientific literature
   on the concepts of interaction and subjectivity can be beneficial for
   conducting psychological research and teaching psychology courses.},

Abstract = {Objective. The study addresses the lack of a method that combines
   systematic reviews with Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). It
   proposes improvements to the SSF (Systematic Search Flow) method,
   introducing new review categories and incorporating AI tools. Method. It
   analyzed 44 types of literature reviews organized into seven distinct

   in faster reviews by filtering the results and analyzing a large volume
   of data. Conclusion. The update of the SSF Method represents a
   significant advance, offering a systematic and efficient guide for
   literature reviews. Although generative AI does not replace the critical
   judgment of the researcher, when guided by experienced researchers, it
   increases the efficiency of the process, making reviews more robust and

   study based on social cognitive career theory and distributed cognition
   theory},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Grounded in Social Cognitive Career Theory and Distributed Cognition
   Theory, this study investigates the mechanism through which teachers'
   transformational leadership influences college students' employability
   in the context of generative artificial intelligence. Employing a
   stratified cluster sampling approach, questionnaire data were collected
   from 311 undergraduates across two universities in Zhejiang Province.
   The findings reveal that students' perceived teachers' transformational
   leadership not only directly and positively influences their
   employability but also exerts indirect effects through three distinct
   pathways: the single mediating role of problem-based learning, the
   single mediating role of self-efficacy, and the chain mediating role of
   problem-based learning and self-efficacy. Furthermore, a moderated chain
   mediation model demonstrates that higher levels of generative artificial
   intelligence usage among students strengthen the chain mediating effect
   of problem-based learning and self-efficacy in the relationship between
   perceived teachers' transformational leadership and employability. These
   results elucidate the intrinsic mechanism by which teachers'
   transformational leadership impacts college students' employability
   empowered by generative artificial intelligence and extend the
   application of Social Cognitive Career Theory and Distributed Cognition
   Theory within the domain of employability research.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and edge intelligence (EI) are
   driving the evolution of traditional vehicular networks toward the
   intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IIoV) by providing foundational and

   characteristics present significant challenges to direct knowledge
   sharing. Furthermore, conventional methods that independently optimize
   fine-tuning and inference lack the foresight to achieve long-term
   network benefits. To address these challenges, we propose the
   GAI-oriented synthetic network (GaisNet), a collaborative cloud-edge-end
   intelligence framework that integrates fine-tuning and inference.
   GaisNet, specifically, can mitigate contradictions by leveraging
   data-free knowledge relays, where bidirectional knowledge flow
   facilitates a virtuous cycle of model fine-tuning and task inference
   with a long-term perspective, fostering mutualism between GAI and EI in
   the IIoV. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
   mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and directions in

Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Text summarization is the process of providing a concise as well as
   cohesive summary, which encapsulates the vital information from the
   original text. Although the supervised models now in use are competent,
   they frequently rely on annotated datasets and create challenges
   regarding uninterpretability and limited generalization ability. To
   overcome the limitations, this research proposes a Generative Artificial
   Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder
   Representations from the Transformers model to generate concise
   summaries. During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes
   into account data from various segments of the input sequence by
   utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique.
   Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing
   grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global
   Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output
   summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate
   summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy.
   Furthermore, the experimental outcomes show that the Generative
   Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder
   Representations from the Transformers model surpasses the conventional
   text summarization techniques concerning Bilingual Evaluation Understudy
   of 0.71 and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering
   of 0.73, which shows that the proposed model generates a meaningful

Abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence (AI) applications is increasing in
   daily life. However, despite its remarkable capabilities, the widespread
   integration of this technology into all aspects of human life also
   carries the risk of causing unforeseen psychological difficulties for
   humanity. For this reason, it is necessary to identify the factors that
   may particularly affect artificial intelligence anxiety. We examined the
   sequential mediation effect of AI literacy and attitudes towards AI on
   the relationship between generative AI acceptance and AI anxiety. The
   study was conducted with 494 university students (Mage = 21.84, SD =
   1.24). The research model was designed according to the PROCESS Macro
   model 80 proposed by Hayes. Data were analyzed using the SPSS v.26
   program, Pearson's correlations, and Hayes's PROCESS macro method for
   mediation. The results revealed that AI anxiety has significant
   relationships with generative AI acceptance, AI literacy, and attitudes
   toward AI. Indirect effect tests supported the mediating relationship
   between attitudes toward AI and AI literacy. These results help us
   understand the underlying mechanism in the relationship between
   generative AI acceptance and AI anxiety.},

Abstract = {Predicting coexistence patterns is a current challenge to understand
   diversity maintenance, especially in rich communities where these
   patterns' complexity is magnified through indirect interactions that
   prevent their approximation with classical experimental approaches. We
   explore cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques called Generative
   Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to predict species coexistence patterns
   in vegetation patches, training generative adversarial networks (GAN)
   and variational AutoEncoders (VAE) that are then used to unravel some of
   the mechanisms behind community assemblage. The GAN accurately
   reproduces real patches' species composition and plant species' affinity
   to different soil types, and the VAE also reaches a high level of
   accuracy, above 99\%. Using the artificially generated patches, we found
   that high-order interactions tend to suppress the positive effects of
   low-order interactions. Finally, by reconstructing successional
   trajectories, we could identify the pioneer species with larger
   potential to generate a high diversity of distinct patches in terms of
   species composition. Understanding the complexity of species coexistence
   patterns in diverse ecological communities requires new approaches
   beyond heuristic rules. Generative Artificial Intelligence can be a
   powerful tool to this end as it allows to overcome the inherent
   dimensionality of this challenge.},

Abstract = {A significant problem in the field of hardware security consists of
   hardware trojan (HT) viruses. The insertion of HTs into a circuit can be
   applied for each phase of the circuit chain of production. HTs degrade
   the infected circuit, destroy it or leak encrypted data. Nowadays,
   efforts are being made to address HTs through machine learning (ML)
   techniques, mainly for the gate-level netlist (GLN) phase, but there are
   some restrictions. Specifically, the number and variety of normal and
   infected circuits that exist through the free public libraries, such as
   Trust-HUB, are based on the few samples of benchmarks that have been
   created from circuits large in size. Thus, it is difficult, based on
   these data, to develop robust ML-based models against HTs. In this
   paper, we propose a new deep learning (DL) tool named Generative
   Artificial Intelligence Netlists SynthesIS (GAINESIS). GAINESIS is based
   on the Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (WCGAN)
   algorithm and area-power analysis features from the GLN phase and
   synthesizes new normal and infected circuit samples for this phase.
   Based on our GAINESIS tool, we synthesized new data sets, different in
   size, and developed and compared seven ML classifiers. The results
   demonstrate that our new generated data sets significantly enhance the
   performance of ML classifiers compared with the initial data set of
   Trust-HUB.},

Abstract = {The emergence of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence systems has

   various areas of socio-economic activity. Education is no exception,
   being profoundly influenced by these technological developments.
   Substantial changes are expected in teaching, learning and assessment
   processes, impacting both teachers and students. Teachers will need to
   acquire new skills to integrate artificial intelligence into their
   teaching activities, and students will have to learn to use these
   technologies to develop their creativity and innovative thinking skills.
   These transformations will influence educational curricula and require
   adjustments in educational policies. Our study focused on how the 292
   students of the Politehnica University of Timi \& scedil;oara, of both
   genders and from 4 years of study, from the undergraduate level, from 9
   faculties perceive artificial intelligence and its impact on their

Abstract = {Generative pretrained transformer models have been popular recently due
   to their enhanced capabilities and performance. In contrast to many
   existing artificial intelligence models, generative pretrained
   transformer models can perform with very limited training data.
   Generative pretrained transformer 3 (GPT-3) is one of the latest
   releases in this pipeline, demonstrating human-like logical and
   intellectual responses to prompts. Some examples include writing essays,
   answering complex questions, matching pronouns to their nouns, and
   conducting sentiment analyses. However, questions remain with regard to
   its implementation in health care, specifically in terms of
   operationalization and its use in clinical practice and research. In
   this viewpoint paper, we briefly introduce GPT-3 and its capabilities
   and outline considerations for its implementation and operationalization
   in clinical practice through a use case. The implementation
   considerations include (1) processing needs and information systems
   infrastructure, (2) operating costs, (3) model biases, and (4)
   evaluation metrics. In addition, we outline the following three major
   operational factors that drive the adoption of GPT-3 in the US health
   care system: (1) ensuring Health Insurance Portability and
   Accountability Act compliance, (2) building trust with health care
   providers, and (3) establishing broader access to the GPT-3 tools. This
   viewpoint can inform health care practitioners, developers, clinicians,
   and decision makers toward understanding the use of the powerful
   artificial intelligence tools integrated into hospital systems and
   health care.},

Abstract = {Creativity has long been viewed as the bastion of human expression. With
   the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI), there is an
   emerging notion of artificial creativity that contests traditional
   perspectives of artistic exploration. This paper explores the complex
   dynamics of this evolution by examining how generative AI intertwines
   with and transforms the art world. It presents a comprehensive analysis
   of the challenges posed by generative AI in art, from questions of
   authenticity and intellectual property to ethical dilemmas and impacts
   on conventional art practices. Simultaneously, it investigates the
   revolutionary opportunities generative AI offers, including the
   democratization of art creation, the expansion of creative boundaries,
   and the development of new collaborative and economic models. The paper
   posits that the integration of generative AI in art is not just a
   technological advancement but a significant cultural shift, which
   necessitates a reevaluation of our understanding of art and the artist.
   It concludes with a forward-looking perspective, advocating for a
   collaborative approach to harness the potential of this technology in
   enriching human creativity and ensuring the vibrant evolution of the art
   world in the era of AI-driven generation.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)
   systems and their impact on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). A
   concise snapshot of the international legal framework will provide the
   coordinates to address the evolution of European and Italian regulations
   on the subject and to place them in the current doctrinal and

   require significant amounts of operational and training data, often
   containing information protected by IPR. Some important US cases are
   laying the foundations for establishing what rights should regulate the
   impact of GenAI on human creativity, and while US courts contemplate
   where and when fair use may be permissible, European institutions have
   recently approved the final test of the first Regulation in the world on
   Artificial Intelligence (AI Act). The challenge is to create a European
   regulatory framework capable of standing the test of time, harmonizing
   national IPR and maximizing the advantages of GenAI in content creation
   without penalizing technological evolution or human creativity. The
   matter is the subject of a lively debate involving men of science and

   emergency department (ED), artificial intelligence driven triage models
   leverage diverse patient data for improved outcome predictions,
   surpassing human performance in retrospective studies. Artificial
   intelligence can streamline medical documentation in the ED and enhances
   medical imaging interpretation. The introduction of large multimodal
   generative models showcases the future potential to process varied
   biomedical data for comprehensive decision support. In the ICU,
   artificial intelligence applications range from early warning systems to
   treatment suggestions.
   Summary Despite promising academic strides, widespread artificial
   intelligence adoption in acute and critical care is hindered by ethical,
   legal, technical, organizational, and validation challenges. Despite
   these obstacles, artificial intelligence's potential to streamline
   clinical workflows is evident. When these barriers are overcome, future
   advancements in artificial intelligence have the potential to transform
   the landscape of patient care for acute and intensive care medicine.},

Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {In this article, an AI-aided generative design workflow is presented for
   the geometrical optimisation of secondary reflectors of linear Fresnel
   concentrating collectors. The geometry of the secondary reflector is
   based on principles of non-imaging optics, for which the exact
   analytical solution is derived for a specific linear Fresnel system
   acting as a validation test case. The artificial intelligence-aided
   generative design workflow is then applied on the same system and the
   optimal geometry generated is compared against the analytical solution.
   It is shown that the secondary reflector geometry obtained from the
   artificial intelligence-aided generative design workflow approaches the
   shape of the one obtained using the analytical solution and can
   outperform the latter with respect to the magnitude of radiative power
   intercepted by the receiver and radiative flux distribution at the
   receiver aperture.},

Month = {2024 DEC 31},
Abstract = {The application of generative artificial intelligence in the tourism
   industry is deepening and playing a key role in enhancing personalized
   services. However, there are still significant gaps in specific studies
   dealing with the subsequent impact on tourists' actual decisions and
   their economic significance. Based on prospect theory and social impact
   theory, this study explores in depth the effects of artificial
   intelligence-generated content and user-generated content on tourists'
   emotions and decision-making process under different goal frameworks.
   Through a series of two scenario-based experiments, this study confirmed
   previous research that gain-framing content is more effective in
   stimulating tourists' emotions and facilitating travel decisions. In
   addition, this study further found that in the context of the use of
   generative artificial intelligence, the loss-framing content will obtain
   the emotional arousal of potential tourists and the generation of travel
   decisions. The research has practical implications for management,
   highlighting potential synergies and collaboration between
   human-generated and artificial intelligence-generated content in
   tourism. Designed to help tourism destination management organizations
   make informed judgments based on accurate information, artificial

Abstract = {Background: A personal statement is a common requirement in medical
   residency and fellowship applications. Generative artificial
   intelligence may be used to create a personal statement for these
   applications. Methods: Two personal statements were created using
   OpenAI's Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and two
   applicant-written statements were collected. A survey was sent to
   obstetric anesthesia fellowship program directors in the United States
   to assess the perceived readability, authenticity, and originality of
   the four personal statements. In addition, the survey assessed
   perceptions of applicants who use artificial intelligence to write a
   personal statement, including their integrity, work ethic, reliability,
   intelligence, and English proficiency. Results: Surveyed fellowship
   directors could not accurately discern whether statements were
   applicant-written or artificial intelligence-generated. The artificial
   intelligence-generated personal statements were rated as more readable
   and original than the applicant-written statements. Most program
   directors were moderately or extremely concerned about the applicant's
   integrity, work ethic, and reliability if they suspected the applicant
   utilized ChatGPT. Conclusions: Program directors could not accurately
   discern if the statements were written by a person or artificial
   intelligence and would have concerns about an applicant suspected of
   using artificial intelligence. Medical training programs may benefit
   from outlining their expectations regarding applicants' use of
   artificial intelligence.},

Abstract = {Objective: To identify and quantify ability bias in generative
   artificial intelligence large language model chatbots, specifically
   OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Design: Observational study of
   language usage in generative artificial intelligence models. Setting:
   Investigation-only browser profile restricted to ChatGPT and Gemini.
   Participants: Each chatbot generated 60 descriptions of people prompted
   without specified functional status, 30 descriptions of people with a
   disability, 30 descriptions of patients with a disability, and 30
   descriptions of athletes with a disability (N=300). Interventions: Not
   applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Generated descriptions produced by
   the models were parsed into words that were linguistically analyzed into
   favorable qualities or limiting qualities. Results: Both large language
   models significantly underestimated disability in a population of
   people, and linguistic analysis showed that descriptions of people,
   patients, and athletes with a disability were generated as having
   significantly fewer favorable qualities and significantly more
   limitations than people without a disability in both ChatGPT and Gemini.
   Conclusions: Generative artificial intelligence chatbots demonstrate
   quantifiable ability bias and often exclude people with disabilities in
   their responses. Ethical use of these generative large language model
   chatbots in medical systems should recognize this limitation, and
   further consideration should be taken in developing equitable artificial
   intelligence technologies.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe rapid development and widespread application of artificial
   intelligence tools have raised concerns about how designers are
   embracing these technologies. This study investigates the factors
   influencing designers' behavioral intention to use and disclose the use
   of generative artificial intelligence.Design/methodology/approachA
   quantitative research approach was employed, designing a structured
   questionnaire based on Self-Determination Theory to assess the impact of
   various psychological and social dimensions. The questionnaire included
   dimensions such as autonomy, competence, relatedness, social influence,
   value fit and social innovativeness. A Partial Least Squares Structural
   Equation Modeling analysis was conducted on 309 valid responses from
   diverse design fields.FindingsCompetence and relatedness are significant
   factors influencing designers' continuance intention to use generative
   artificial intelligence. Although autonomy does not significantly affect
   continuance intention, it plays a crucial role in the decision to
   disclose artificial intelligence participation. Social influence and
   value fit significantly shape autonomy, competence and relatedness,
   while the impact of social innovativeness is relatively
   limited.Originality/valueThis study clarifies the factors influencing
   designers' continuance intention and disclosure of generative artificial
   intelligence tools from both individual and social dimensions, enhancing
   the understanding of the relationship between designers and generative
   artificial intelligence tools. It provides valuable insights for the
   development of artificial intelligence technology and the future trends

Abstract = {Digital storytelling and generative artificial intelligence (AI)
   platforms have emerged as transformative tools that empower individuals
   to write with confidence and share their stories effectively. However, a
   research gap exists in understanding the effects of using such web-based
   platforms on narrative intelligence and writing self-efficacy. This
   study aims to investigate whether digital story creation tasks on
   web-based platforms can influence the narrative intelligence and writing
   self-efficacy of undergraduate students. A pretest-posttest comparison
   study between two groups was conducted with sixty-four undergraduate
   students (n = 64), majoring in Primary Education. More specifically, it
   compares the effects of the most well-known conventional platforms, such
   as Storybird, Storyjumper, and ZooBurst (control condition), and
   generative AI platforms, such as Sudowrite, Jasper, and Shortly AI
   (experimental condition) on undergraduate students, with an equal
   distribution in each group. The findings indicate that the utilization
   of generative AI platforms in the context of story creation tasks can
   substantially enhance both narrative intelligence scores and writing
   self-efficacy when compared to conventional platforms. Nonetheless,
   there was no significant difference in the creative identity factor.
   Generative AI platforms have promising implications for supporting

Abstract = {In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI)
   technology has created new possibilities for designing and developing
   diverse learning experiences. Given the capabilities of this new
   generation of generative AI tools represented by ChatGPT, it is no
   surprise that many online instructors are simultaneously amazed and
   alarmed when considering the implications for online learning.
   Researchers have found that generative AI tools like ChatGPT have
   promising applications in interpreting educational questions and
   generating solutions, improving learning outcomes as well as enhancing
   student engagement, emphasizing academic integrity, and assisting with
   assessment design. Still, embracing this AI chatbot requires a thorough
   understanding of its affordances and limitations. In this reflection, we
   problematize the questions around the use of generative AI for
   education. We explore the design principles and strategies for creating
   successful AI-enhanced online learning experiences while considering
   ethical and social issues of generative AI in online learning.},

   Generative AI is a machine capable of producing texts in various genres.
   In the global historical context, the significance of this technology
   cannot be underestimated, as the artificial language of code intertwines
   with the natural language of everyday life. The writing capability of
   Generative AI is multimodal, going beyond the predominantly verbal
   production of text, also being able to << read >> and << write >> images
   through textual labels and prompts. Additionally, this peculiar form of
   writing encompasses mathematical concepts, software procedures, and
   algorithms. Based on these considerations, this article investigates the
   implications of Generative AI in the teaching and learning of literacy
   and reading. Initially, we explore the challenges and impacts of
   Generative AI on literacy practices. Then, we present a case study that
   exemplifies the practical implementation of Generative AI in supporting
   literacy and learning. Finally, we outline broad implications for
   teaching and learning, proposing a new agenda for literacy in the era of

   fact that ChatGPT-4 is capable of passing the New York Bar Exam, that
   courts are adopting Generative AI in their decision-making, and that a
   New York lawyer has been sanctioned by a judge for relying upon
   non-existent case law precedent that he obtained from ChatGPT-4 and did
   not double-check.
   Yet, putting aside these newsworthy developments, tools powered by other
   forms of artificial intelligence (hereinafter ``AI{''}) have already
   been relied upon in legal practice for many years. This article
   introduces how AI supports successful international arbitration
   practice, including uses and methods that are already available and

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been selectively
   adopted across the academic community to help researchers complete tasks
   in a more efficient manner. The widespread release of the Chat
   Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) platform in 2022 has made
   these tools more accessible to scholars around the world. Despite their
   tremendous potential, studies have uncovered that large language model
   (LLM)-based generative AI tools have issues with plagiarism, AI

   writing process. We first explore how academic publishers are
   positioning the use of generative AI tools and then describe potential
   issues with using these tools in the academic writing process. Finally,
   we discuss three categories of specific ways generative AI tools can be
   used in an ethically sound manner and offer four key principles that can

Journal = {ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {170-189},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence has become an essential element oftechnological
   progress, while generative artificial intelligence occupies a special
   place as an innovative general-purpose technology. Given the rapid
   development of this technology and its high potential for mass adoption
   in various economic sectors, it becomes important to assess the impact
   of this technology on the labor market. The modern Russian labor market
   is characterized by low unemployment, staff shortages, and intersectoral
   imbalances. An urgent scientific task is to model scenarios for the
   development of the labor market in the context of sectors, taking into
   account the influence of generative artificial intelligence. The aim of
   the work is to assess the potential impact of the mass use of generative
   artificial intelligence on the labor market, due to changes in labor
   efficiency in some professions and industries, based on the analysis of
   statistical and expert data and economic and mathematical modeling of
   possible scenarios for the development of the labor market. Economic
   sectors were divided into three groups depending on the rate of change
   in personnel needs, based on the analysis of the Beveridge curve, which
   shows the dependence of the level of needs on the unemployment rate.
   Using existing statistical data and expert assessments, we determine the
   degree of influence of generative artificial intelligence on labor
   efficiency in various industries. We put forward an approach that helps
   to obtain estimates of possible scenarios for the development of
   sectoral labor markets for the period up to 2030, based on official
   forecasts of ministries (Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian
   Federation, Ministry of Labor of the Russian Federation) for the period
   up to 2026, their extrapolation, and superimposition of the impact of
   mass use of generative artificial intelligence (as a disturbing effect).
   The results obtained suggest that the severity of staff shortage issue
   in general can be partially reduced by using generative artificial
   intelligence; thus, we identified industries in which (a) it is possible
   to address the problem of staff shortage at the current level of needs,
   and (b) staff shortage will persist. Modeling the migration of
   professions and personnel between industries seems promising, because
   the expected effect of mass technology adoption will not only change the
   balance of labor resources, but also lead to the need to re-profile some
   of the personnel.},

   Critical Thinking Skills: What, How, and Why},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Despite the increasing number of studies indicating that generative
   artificial intelligence is conducive to cultivating college students'
   critical thinking skills, research on the impact of college students'
   use of generative artificial intelligence on their critical thinking
   skills in an open learning environment is still scarce. This study aims
   to investigate whether the use of generative artificial intelligence by
   college students in an open learning environment can effectively enhance
   their critical thinking skills. The study is centered around the
   following questions: Does the use of generative artificial intelligence
   in an open learning environment enhance college students' critical
   thinking skills (what)? What is the mechanism by which the use of
   generative artificial intelligence affects college students' critical
   thinking (how)? From the perspective of self-regulated learning theory
   and learning motivation theory, what are the reasons for the impact of
   generative artificial intelligence on college students' critical
   thinking skills (why)? To this end, the study employs questionnaires and
   interviews to collect data. The questionnaire data are subjected to
   descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, multiple
   stepwise regression analysis, and mediation effect analysis. Based on
   the analysis of interview materials and survey questionnaire data, the
   study reveals the impacts and mechanisms of college students' use of
   generative artificial intelligence tools on their critical thinking
   skills. The findings of the study are as follows. First, the frequency
   of artificial intelligence use is unrelated to critical thinking skills,
   but using it for reflective thinking helps to develop critical thinking
   skills. Second, students with strong self-regulated learning skills are
   more likely to use generative artificial intelligence for reflective
   thinking and achieve better development in critical thinking skills.
   Third, students with strong intrinsic learning motivation are more
   likely to use generative artificial intelligence for reflective thinking
   and achieve better development in critical thinking skills.
   Consequently, the article analyzes the reasons from the perspectives of
   self-regulated learning theory and learning motivation theory and offers
   insights into how to properly use generative artificial intelligence to
   promote the development of critical thinking skills from the
   perspectives of higher education institutions, college teachers, and
   college students.},

Abstract = {Purpose This conceptual paper examines what underlies decision-making in
   generative change processes to explore how generative artificial
   intelligence (GAI) might shape the future of organisational
   change.Design/methodology/approach This investigation draws on Snowden
   and Stanbridge's (2004) social complexity concept, Archer's (1995)
   morphogenetic/morphostatic explanatory methodology and Mackenzie and
   Bititci's (2023) social systems-based model for organisational change to
   explain how structure, culture and agency influence generative change
   processes in complex adaptive social systems.Findings Both human-based
   decision-making and machine-based decision-making have roles to play in
   generative change. This paper proposes that human reflexivity mediates
   ideas, whereas the material aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) and
   GAI mediate tasks. The former shapes the change interventions that take
   place and the latter contributes to their more effective
   execution.Practical implications In generative change processes, AI and
   GAI technologies should be focused on tasks that support human-based
   decision-making.Originality/value This paper explores decision-making in

Title = {Faith and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Catholic Education: A
   Theological Virtue Ethics Perspective},
Journal = {RELIGIONS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {This study responds to the increasing call for thoughtful theological
   and ethical engagement with Artificial Intelligence (AI) by examining
   the role of personal theological reflection using Generative Artificial
   Intelligence (GenAI) content in Catholic theological education. It
   investigates how both educators and students might utilize AI-generated
   imagery as a pedagogical resource with which to enrich theological
   insight and foster ethical discernment, particularly through the lens of
   theological virtue ethics. AI is not a substitute for all human tasks.
   However, the use of AI holds potential for theology and catechetical
   religious education. Following Gl \& auml;ser-Zikuda's model of
   Self-Reflecting Methods of Learning Research, this study systematically
   engages in reflective observation to examine how the use of GenAI in
   theology classrooms has influenced personal theological thinking,
   pedagogical practices, and ethical considerations. It documents
   experiences using common generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Canva,
   Meta AI, Deep AI, and Gencraft in theology classes. The principles of
   virtue ethics and Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) offer a
   critical framework for ethical, pedagogical, and theological engagement.
   The findings contribute to the emerging interdisciplinary discourse on
   AI ethics and theology, and religious pedagogy in the digital age.},

Title = {The impact of new generative AI chatbots on the switch point (SP):
   toward an artificial emotional awareness (AEA)},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {2029-2053},
Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {Purpose-This paper aims to contribute to the discussion on integrating
   humans and technology in customer service within the framework of
   Society 5.0, which emphasizes the growing role of artificial
   intelligence (AI). It examines how effectively new generative AI-based
   chatbots can handle customer emotions and explores their impact on
   determining the point at which a customer-machine interaction should be
   transferred to a human agent to prevent customer disengagement, referred
   to as the Switch Point (SP). Design/methodology/approach-To evaluate the
   capabilities of new generative AI-based chatbots in managing emotions,
   ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini and Copilot are tested using the Trait Emotional
   Intelligence Questionnaire Short-Form (TEIQue-SF). A reference framework
   is developed to illustrate the shift in the Switch Point (SP).
   Findings-Using the four-intelligence framework (mechanical, analytical,
   intuitive and empathetic), this study demonstrates that, despite
   advancements in AI's ability to address emotions in customer service,
   even the most advanced chatbots-such as ChatGPT, Gemini and
   Copilot-still fall short of replicating the empathetic capabilities of
   human intelligence (HI). The concept of artificial emotional awareness
   (AEA) is introduced to characterize the intuitive intelligence of new
   generative AI chatbots in understanding customer emotions and triggering
   the SP. A complementary rather than replacement perspective of HI and AI
   is proposed, highlighting the impact of generative AI on the SP.
   Research limitations/implications-This study is exploratory in nature
   and requires further theoretical development and empirical validation.
   Practical implications-The study has only an exploratory character with
   respect to the possible real impact of the introduction of the new
   generative AI-based chatbots on collaborative approaches to the
   integration of humans and technology in Society 5.0.
   Originality/value-Customer Relationship Management managers can use the
   proposed framework as a guide to adopt a dynamic approach to HI-AI
   collaboration in AI-driven customer service.},

Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {As advances in artificial intelligence (AI) continue to transform and
   revolutionize the field of medicine, understanding the potential uses of
   generative AI in health care becomes increasingly important. Generative
   AI, including models such as generative adversarial networks and large
   language models, shows promise in transforming medical diagnostics,
   research, treatment planning, and patient care. However, these data
   -intensive systems pose new threats to protected health information.
   This Viewpoint paper aims to explore various categories of generative AI
   in health care, including medical diagnostics, drug discovery, virtual
   health assistants, medical research, and clinical decision support,
   while identifying security and privacy threats within each phase of the
   life cycle of such systems (ie, data collection, model development, and
   implementation phases). The objectives of this study were to analyze the
   current state of generative AI in health care, identify opportunities
   and privacy and security challenges posed by integrating these
   technologies into existing health care infrastructure, and propose
   strategies for mitigating security and privacy risks. This study
   highlights the importance of addressing the security and privacy threats
   associated with generative AI in health care to ensure the safe and
   effective use of these systems. The findings of this study can inform
   the development of future generative AI systems in health care and help
   health care organizations better understand the potential benefits and
   risks associated with these systems. By examining the use cases and
   benefits of generative AI across diverse domains within health care,
   this paper contributes to theoretical discussions surrounding AI ethics,
   security vulnerabilities, and data privacy regulations. In addition,
   this study provides practical insights for stakeholders looking to adopt
   generative AI solutions within their organizations.},

Abstract = {The introduction of accessible generative artificial intelligence opens
   promising opportunities for the implementation of personalized learning
   methods in any educational environment. Personalized learning has been
   conceptualized for a long time, but it has only recently become
   realistic and truly achievable. In this paper, we propose an affordable
   and sustainable approach toward personalizing learning materials as part
   of the complete educational process. We have created a tool within a
   pre-existing learning management system at a software engineering
   college that automatically generates learning materials based on the
   learning outcomes provided by the professor for a particular class. The
   learning materials were composed in three distinct styles, the initial
   one being the traditional professor style and the other two variations
   adopting a pop-culture influence, namely Batman and Wednesday Addams.
   Each lesson, besides being delivered in three different formats,
   contained automatically generated multiple-choice questions that
   students could use to check their progress. This paper contains complete
   instructions for developing such a tool with the help of large language
   models using OpenAI's API and an analysis of the preliminary experiment
   of its usage performed with the help of 20 college students studying
   software engineering at a European university. Participation in the
   study was optional and on voluntary basis. Each student's tool usage was
   quantified, and two questionnaires were conducted: one immediately after
   subject completion and another 6 months later to assess both immediate
   and long-term effects, perceptions, and preferences. The results
   indicate that students found the multiple variants of the learning
   materials really engaging. While predominantly utilizing the traditional
   variant of the learning materials, they found this approach inspiring,
   would recommend it to other students, and would like to see it more in
   classes. The most popular feature were the automatically generated
   quiz-style tests that they used to assess their understanding.
   Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of various versions of
   learning materials leads to an increase in students' study time,
   especially for students who have not mastered the topic otherwise. The
   study's small sample size of 20 students restricts its ability to
   generalize its findings, but its results provide useful early insights
   and lay the groundwork for future research on AI-supported educational
   strategies.},

Abstract = {The use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in academia is a
   subjective and hotly debated topic. Currently, there are no agreed
   guidelines towards the usage of GenAI systems in higher education (HE)
   and, thus, it is still unclear how to make effective use of the
   technology for teaching and learning practice. This paper provides an
   overview of the current state of research on GenAI for teaching and
   learning in HE. To this end, this study conducted a systematic review of
   relevant studies indexed by Scopus, using the preferred reporting items
   for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search
   criteria revealed a total of 625 research papers, of which 355 met the

   current state and the future trends in documents, citations, document
   sources/authors, keywords, and co-authorship. The research gaps
   identified suggest that while some authors have looked at understanding
   the detection of AI-generated text, it may be beneficial to understand
   how GenAI can be incorporated into supporting the educational curriculum
   for assessments, teaching, and learning delivery. Furthermore, there is
   a need for additional interdisciplinary, multidimensional studies in HE

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence offers a fresh view on molecular
   design. We present the first-time prospective application of a deep
   learning model for designing new druglike compounds with desired
   activities. For this purpose, we trained a recurrent neural network to
   capture the constitution of a large set of known bioactive compounds
   represented as SMILES strings. By transfer learning, this general model
   was fine-tuned on recognizing retinoid X and peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor agonists. We synthesized five
   top-ranking compounds designed by the generative model. Four of the
   compounds revealed nanomolar to low-micromolar receptor modulatory
   activity in cell-based assays. Apparently, the computational model
   intrinsically captured relevant chemical and biological knowledge
   without the need for explicit rules. The results of this study advocate
   generative artificial intelligence for prospective de novo molecular
   design, and demonstrate the potential of these methods for future
   medicinal chemistry.},

Abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) represents a shift from AI's ability to
   ``recognize{''} to its ability to ``generate{''} solutions for a wide
   range of tasks. As generated solutions and applications grow more
   complex and multi-faceted, new needs, objectives, and possibilities for
   explainability (XAI) have emerged. This work elaborates on why XAI has
   gained importance with the rise of GenAI and the challenges it poses for
   explainability research. We also highlight new and emerging criteria
   that explanations should meet, such as verifiability, interactivity,
   security, and cost considerations. To achieve this, we focus on
   surveying existing literature. Additionally, we provide a taxonomy of
   relevant dimensions to better characterize existing XAI mechanisms and
   methods for GenAI. We explore various approaches to ensure XAI, ranging
   from training data to prompting. Our paper provides a concise technical
   background of GenAI for non-technical readers, focusing on text and
   images to help them understand new or adapted XAI techniques for GenAI.
   However, due to the extensive body of work on GenAI, we chose not to
   delve into detailed aspects of XAI related to the evaluation and usage
   of explanations. Consequently, the manuscript appeals to both technical
   experts and professionals from other fields, such as social scientists

Abstract = {Generative AI (GAI) has emerged as a significant advancement in
   artificial intelligence, renowned for its language and image generation
   capabilities. This paper presents ``AI-Generated Everything{''} (AIGX),
   a concept that extends GAI beyond mere content creation to real-time
   adaptation and control across diverse technological domains. In
   networking, AIGX collaborates closely with physical, data link, network,
   and application layers to enhance real-time network management that
   responds to various system and service settings as well as application
   and user requirements. Networks, in return, serve as crucial components
   in further AIGX capability optimization through the AIGX lifecycle,
   i.e., data collection, distributed pre-training, and rapid
   decision-making, thereby establishing a mutually enhancing interplay.
   Moreover, we offer an in-depth case study focused on power allocation to
   illustrate the interdependence between AIGX and networking systems.
   Through this exploration, the article analyzes the significant role of
   GAI for networking, clarifies the ways networks augment AIGX

Volume = {15},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {The advent and growing popularity of generative artificial intelligence
   (GenAI) holds the potential to revolutionise AI applications in forensic
   psychiatry and criminal justice, which traditionally relied on
   discriminative AI algorithms. Generative AI models mark a significant
   shift from the previously prevailing paradigm through their ability to
   generate seemingly new realistic data and analyse and integrate a vast
   amount of unstructured content from different data formats. This
   potential extends beyond reshaping conventional practices, like risk
   assessment, diagnostic support, and treatment and rehabilitation plans,
   to creating new opportunities in previously underexplored areas, such as
   training and education. This paper examines the transformative impact of
   generative artificial intelligence on AI applications in forensic
   psychiatry and criminal justice. First, it introduces generative AI and
   its prevalent models. Following this, it reviews the current
   applications of discriminative AI in forensic psychiatry. Subsequently,
   it presents a thorough exploration of the potential of generative AI to
   transform established practices and introduce novel applications through
   multimodal generative models, data generation and data augmentation.
   Finally, it provides a comprehensive overview of ethical and legal
   issues associated with deploying generative AI models, focusing on their
   impact on individuals as well as their broader societal implications. In
   conclusion, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse
   concerning the dynamic challenges of generative AI applications in
   forensic contexts, highlighting potential opportunities, risks, and
   challenges. It advocates for interdisciplinary collaboration and
   emphasises the necessity for thorough, responsible evaluations of
   generative AI models before widespread adoption into domains where
   decisions with substantial life-altering consequences are routinely

Abstract = {Self-adaptive systems (SASs) are designed to handle changes and
   uncertainties through a feedback loop with four core functionalities:
   monitoring, analyzing, planning, and execution. Recently, generative
   artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language
   models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and
   logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the
   functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to
   employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and
   challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a
   comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex
   due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the
   technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid
   evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this article aims to
   provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that
   outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's
   within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from
   four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories
   to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered
   around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii)
   improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within
   human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research
   roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs.
   The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to
   be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of
   SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on
   current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation
   strategies.},

Title = {Exploring the Effect of Generative AI on Social Sustainability Through
   Integrating AI Attributes, TPB, and T-EESST: A Deep Learning-Based
   Hybrid SEM-ANN Approach},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {14512-14524},
Abstract = {The swift progress of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools
   offers remarkable potential for revolutionizing educational methods and
   enhancing social sustainability. Despite its potential, understanding
   the factors driving its adoption and how that affects social
   sustainability remains underexplored. This study aims to address this
   gap by integrating AI attributes ({''}perceived anthropomorphism,{''}
   ``perceived intelligence,{''} and ``perceived animacy{''}) with the
   theory of planned behavior and the technology-environmental, economic,
   and social sustainability theory (T-EESST) to develop a theoretical
   research model. Utilizing a hybrid structural equation modeling and
   artificial neural network approach, we analyzed data collected from 1048
   university students to evaluate the developed model. Our findings
   revealed that while perceived behavioral control has an insignificant
   impact on generative AI use, attitudes emerge as the most critical
   factor, further reinforced by the significant role of subjective norms.
   Perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived
   animacy were also found to influence students' attitudes significantly.
   More importantly, the findings supported the role of generative AI in
   positively affecting social sustainability, aligning with the principles
   of T-EESST. This study's significance lies in its holistic examination
   of the interplay between technological attributes, motivational aspects,
   and sustainability outcomes, offering valuable insights for various
   stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) promises various new opportunities to
   create and appropriate business value. However, many organizations -
   especially those in more traditional industries - struggle to seize
   these opportunities. To unpack the underlying reasons, we investigate
   how more traditional industries implement predictive maintenance, a
   promising application of AI in manufacturing organizations. For our
   analysis, we employ a multiple-case design and adopt a critical realist
   perspective to identify generative mechanisms of AI implementation.
   Overall, we find five interdependent mechanisms: experimentation;
   knowledge building and integration; data; anxiety; and inspiration.
   Using causal loop diagramming, we flesh out the socio-technical dynamics
   of these mechanisms and explore the organizational requirements of
   implementing AI. The resulting topology of generative mechanisms
   contributes to the research on AI management by offering rich insights
   into the cause-effect relationships that shape the implementation
   process. Moreover, it demonstrates how causal loop diagraming can
   improve the modeling and analysis of generative mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has become a focal point of interest across
   various sectors due to its ability to generate creative and realistic
   outputs. A specific subset, generative artificial intelligence, has seen
   significant growth, particularly in late 2022. Tools like ChatGPT,
   Dall-E, or Midjourney have democratized access to Large Language Models,
   enabling the creation of human-like content. However, the concept
   `Generative Artificial Intelligence' lacks a universally accepted
   definition, leading to potential misunderstandings. While a model that
   produces any output can be technically seen as generative, the
   Artificial Intelligent research community often reserves the term for
   complex models that generate high-quality, human-like material. This
   paper presents a literature mapping of AI-driven content generation,
   analyzing 631 solutions published over the last five years to better
   understand and characterize the Generative Artificial Intelligence
   landscape. Our findings suggest a dichotomy in the understanding and
   application of the term ``Generative AI{''}. While the broader public
   often interprets ``Generative AI{''} as AI-driven creation of tangible
   content, the AI research community mainly discusses generative
   implementations with an emphasis on the models in use, without
   explicitly categorizing their work under the term ``Generative AI{''}.},

Abstract = {In recent years, drug discovery and life sciences have been
   revolutionized with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)
   methods. Quantum computing is touted to be the next most significant
   leap in technology; one of the main early practical applications for
   quantum com-puting solutions is predicted to be in quantum chemistry
   simulations. Here, we review the near-term applications of quantum
   computing and their advantages for gener-ative chemistry and highlight
   the challenges that can be addressed with noisy intermediate-scale
   quantum (NISQ) devices. We also discuss the possible integration of
   generative systems running on quantum computers into established
   generative AI platforms.},

Abstract = {Generative AI refers specifically to a class of Artificial Intelligence
   models that use existing data to create new content that reflects the
   underlying patterns of real-world data. This contribution presents a
   study that aims to show what the current perception of arts educators
   and students of arts education is with regard to generative Artificial
   Intelligence. It is a qualitative research study using focus groups as a
   data collection technique in order to obtain an overview of the
   participating subjects. The research design consists of two phases: (1)
   generation of illustrations from prompts by students, professionals and
   a generative AI tool; and (2) focus groups with students (N = 5) and
   educators (N = 5) of artistic education. In general, the perception of
   educators and students coincides in the usefulness of generative AI as a
   tool to support the generation of illustrations. However, they agree
   that the human factor cannot be replaced by generative AI. The results
   obtained allow us to conclude that generative AI can be used as a
   motivating educational strategy for arts education.},

Title = {Synthetic ethnography: Field devices for the qualitative study of
   generative models},
Journal = {BIG DATA \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Advancements in generative artificial intelligence have led to a rapid
   proliferation of machine learning models capable of synthesizing text,
   images, sounds, and other kinds of content. While the increasing realism
   of synthetic content stokes fears about misinformation and triggers
   debates around intellectual property, generative models are adopted
   across creative industries and synthetic media seep into cultural
   production. Qualitative research in the social and human sciences has
   dedicated comparatively little attention to this category of machine
   learning, particularly in terms of what types of novel research
   methodology they both demand and facilitate. In this article, we propose
   a methodological approach for the qualitative study of generative models
   grounded on the experimentation with field devices which we call
   synthetic ethnography. Synthetic ethnography is not simply a qualitative
   research methodology applied to the study of the social and cultural
   contexts developing around generative artificial intelligence, but also
   strives to envision practical and experimental ways to repurpose these
   models as research tools in their own right. After briefly introducing
   generative models and revisiting the trajectory of digital ethnographic
   research, we discuss three case studies for which the authors have
   developed experimental field devices to study different aspects of
   generative artificial intelligence ethnographically. In the conclusion,
   we derive a broader methodological proposal from these case studies,
   arguing that synthetic ethnography facilitates insights into how the
   algorithmic processes, training datasets and latent spaces behind these
   systems modulate bias, reconfigure agency, and challenge epistemological
   categories.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven generative chatbots can produce
   large quantities of text instantly across a range of domains, using

   critical synthesis compares artificial expertise and human expertise and
   examines ways in which generative chatbots can support cognition using

   may support experts' cognition as a collaborator or to offload lower
   level tasks. Moreover, generative chatbots are a promising training tool
   in developing future experts in part because they can provide learning
   models and practice opportunities. The use of generative chatbots to
   offload lower level tasks, however, may harm expert development by
   disrupting knowledge communities. Finally, a lack of domain knowledge in
   nonexpert users may limit the effectiveness of generative chatbots in
   supporting higher level cognition and agency. Overall, existing research
   suggests that the potential for generative chatbots to support users'
   cognition depends on a user's level of expertise.},

Journal = {ALGORITHMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has impressed the
   world with its ability to create text, images, and videos. However,
   there are still areas in which GAI produces undesirable or unintended
   results due to being ``uncertain{''}. Before wider use of AI-generated
   content, it is important to identify concepts where GAI is uncertain to
   ensure the usage thereof is ethical and to direct efforts for
   improvement. This study proposes a general pipeline to automatically
   quantify uncertainty within GAI. To measure uncertainty, the textual
   prompt to a text-to-image model is compared to captions supplied by four
   image-to-text models (GIT, BLIP, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP). Its
   evaluation is based on machine translation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR,
   and SPICE) and word embedding's cosine similarity (Word2Vec, GloVe,
   FastText, DistilRoBERTa, MiniLM-6, and MiniLM-12). The generative AI
   models performed consistently across the metrics; however, the vector
   space models yielded the highest average similarity, close to 80\%,
   which suggests more ideal and ``certain{''} results. Suggested future
   work includes identifying metrics that best align with a human baseline
   to ensure quality and consideration for more GAI models. The work within
   can be used to automatically identify concepts in which GAI is
   ``uncertain{''} to drive research aimed at increasing confidence in
   these areas.},

Title = {Leveraging Generative AI for Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance},
Journal = {CURRENT REVIEWS IN CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {89-97},
Abstract = {Predictions are made by artificial intelligence, especially through
   machine learning, which uses algorithms and past knowledge. Notably,
   there has been an increase in interest in using artificial intelligence,
   particularly generative AI, in the pharmacovigilance of pharmaceuticals
   under development, as well as those already in the market. This review
   was conducted to understand how generative AI can play an important role
   in pharmacovigilance and improving drug safety monitoring. Data from
   previously published articles and news items were reviewed in order to
   obtain information. We used PubMed and Google Scholar as our search
   engines, and keywords (pharmacovigilance, artificial intelligence,
   machine learning, drug safety, and patient safety) were used. In toto,
   we reviewed 109 articles published till 31st January 2024, and the
   obtained information was interpreted, compiled, evaluated, and
   conclusions were reached. Generative AI has transformative potential in
   pharmacovigilance, showcasing benefits, such as enhanced adverse event
   detection, data-driven risk prediction, and optimized drug development.
   By making it easier to process and analyze big datasets, generative
   artificial intelligence has applications across a variety of disease
   states. Machine learning and automation in this field can streamline
   pharmacovigilance procedures and provide a more efficient way to assess
   safety-related data. Nevertheless, more investigation is required to
   determine how this optimization affects the caliber of safety analyses.
   In the near future, the increased utilization of artificial intelligence
   is anticipated, especially in predicting side effects and Adverse Drug
   Reactions (ADRs).},

Abstract = {The rapid progress of Artificial intelligence in generative modeling is
   marred by widespread misuse. In response, researchers turn to use-based
   restrictions-contractual terms prohibiting certain uses-as a
   ``solution{''} for abuse. While these restrictions can be beneficial to
   artificial intelligence governance in API-gated settings, their failings
   are especially significant in open-source models: not only do they lack
   any means of enforcement, but they also perpetuate the current
   proliferation of tokenistic efforts toward ethical artificial
   intelligence. This observation echoes growing literature that points to
   useless efforts in ``AI ethics,{''} and underscores the need to shift
   from this paradigm. This article provides an overview of these drawbacks
   and argues that researchers should divert their efforts to studying
   deployable, effective, and theoretically grounded solutions like
   watermarking and model alignment from human feedback to effect tangible

   positioning in the research ecosystem. In particular, we argue that
   generative artificial intelligence will reinforce the importance of

   analyzing the central part of our investigation, which takes the form of
   four collaborative workshops conducted in 2023 with external partners in
   different domains (the art scene, art therapy, education, and the news
   media). After analyzing insights from these workshops, the article
   significantly nuances how visual citizenship is at work in different

Abstract = {The core challenge in directed energy deposition is to obtain high
   surface quality through process optimisation, which directly affects the
   mechanical properties of fabricated parts. However, for expensive
   materials like Ti-6Al-4V, the cost and time required to optimise process
   parameters can be excessive in inducing good surface quality. To
   mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel method with artificial
   intelligence to generate virtual surface morphology of Ti-6Al-4V parts
   by given process parameters. A high-resolution surface morphology image
   generation system has been developed by optimising conditional
   generative adversarial networks. The developed virtual surface matches
   experimental cases well with an Frechet inception distance score of 174,
   in the range of accurate matching. Microstructural analysis with parts
   fabricated with artificial intelligence guidance exhibited less textured
   microstructural behaviour on the surface which reduces the anisotropy in
   the columnar structure. This artificial intelligence guidance of virtual
   surface morphology can help to obtain high-quality parts
   cost-effectively.},

Abstract = {Despite the transformative potential of generative artificial
   intelligence (AI) systems within enterprise digital platforms, there
   still exist gaps in understanding the challenges and strategies
   associated with their adoption. Addressing this pressing issue, this
   article draws upon institutional theory to delve into the drivers
   influencing firms' adoption of generative AI within their enterprise
   digital platforms. Leveraging survey data collected from 328 firms that
   have implemented digital platforms to support their business operations,
   we find that institutional pressures positively influence generative AI
   adoption within their enterprise digital platforms. Furthermore, we
   identify salient moderating effects of policy uncertainty and innovative
   culture in shaping the relationships. Our research findings make a
   substantial contribution to AI literature by illuminating the potential
   challenges and strategies toward generative AI adoption as well as
   reassessing the application of institutional theory within the digital
   landscape.},

   artificial-intelligence-powered platforms projected to drive market
   growth to nearly \$740 billion by 2030. However, scholarly understanding

   This article explores how generative pre-trained transformers influence

   generative artificial intelligence capabilities reinforce or challenge
   existing platform dominance. Using a conceptual literature analysis of
   platforms and artificial intelligence development patterns, the research
   uncovers a critical paradox: While generative pre-trained transformers

   creating self-reinforcing cycles of artificial intelligence capability
   enhancement. This research demonstrates how artificial intelligence

   analysis of the challenges and opportunities presented by students'
   increasing use of generative artificial intelligence in healthcare
   education, with particular focus on assessment approaches, critical
   thinking development and artificial intelligence literacy. Results:
   Students' widespread use of generative artificial intelligence threatens

   develop the architectural proposal, we incorporated the results of the
   student survey along with insights gained from analyzing the
   architectures of other learning platforms. The proposed architecture is
   based on a study of adaptive learning platforms with classically virtual

Title = {Nurse Researchers' Experiences and Perceptions of Generative AI:
   Qualitative Semistructured Interview Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {27},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Background: With the rapid development and iteration of generative
   artificial intelligence, the growing popularity of such groundbreaking
   tools among nurse researchers, represented by ChatGPT (OpenAI), is
   receiving passionate debate and intrigue. Although there has been
   qualitative research on generative artificial intelligence in other
   fields, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of nurse
   researchers; this study seeks to report on the topic. Objective: This
   study aimed to describe the experiences and perceptions of generative
   artificial intelligence among Chinese nurse researchers, as well as
   provide a reference for the application of generative artificial
   intelligence in nursing research in the future. Methods: Semistructured
   interviews were used to collect data in this qualitative study.
   Researchers mainly conducted interviews on the cognition, experience,
   and future expectations of nurse researchers regarding the use of
   generative artificial intelligence. Twenty-seven nurse researchers were
   included in the study. Through purposive sampling and snowball sampling,
   there were 7 nursing faculty researchers, 10 nursing graduate students,
   and 10 clinical nurse researchers. Data were analyzed using inductive
   content analysis. Results: Five themes and 12 subthemes were categorized
   from 27 original interview documents as follows: (1) diverse reflections
   on human-machine symbiosis, which includes the interplay between
   substitution and assistance, researchers shaping the potential of
   generative artificial intelligence, and acceptance of generative
   artificial intelligence with alacrity; (2) multiple factors of the usage
   experience, including individual characteristics and various usage
   scenarios; (3) research paradigm reshaping in the infancy stage, which
   involves full-process groundbreaking assistive tools and emergence of
   new research paths; (4) application risks of generative artificial
   intelligence, including intrinsic limitations of generative artificial
   intelligence and academic integrity and medical ethics; and (5) the
   co-improvement of technology and literacy, which concerns reinforcement
   needs for generative artificial intelligence literacy, development of
   nursing research generative artificial intelligence and urgent need for
   artificial intelligence-generated content detection tools. In this
   context, the first 4 themes form the rocket of the human-machine
   symbiosis journey. Only when humans fully leverage the advantages of
   machines (generative artificial intelligence) and overcome their
   shortcomings can this human-machine symbiosis journey reach the correct
   future direction (fifth theme). Conclusions: This study explored the
   experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers interacting with
   generative artificial intelligence, which was a ``symbiotic journey{''}
   full of twists and turns, and provides a reference and basis for
   achieving harmonious coexistence between nurse researchers and
   generative artificial intelligence in the future. Nurse researchers,
   policy makers, and application developers can use the conclusions of
   this study to further promote the application of generative artificial
   intelligence in nursing research, policy making, and product
   development.},

   approach to examine the association between individual personality
   traits and tolerance of generative AI hallucinations. Drawing on error
   management theory and the big five personality traits, we examine how
   individuals with different personality traits tolerate generative AI
   hallucinations. The study contributes to calls from management journals
   to investigate the challenges associated with generative AI use. Our

   their impact on journalism practices and the news production process.
   Data from in-depth interviews with 26 journalists from various media
   organizations in T \& uuml;rkiye were analyzed using thematic analysis.
   The findings indicate that although Generative Artificial Intelligence
   tools save considerable time on journalism tasks such as translation,
   summarization, and fact-checking, they have not significantly reduced
   journalists' overall workload. Additionally, the use of Generative
   Artificial Intelligence tools in reporting on sensitive, complex issues
   (e.g. foreign news, women's and children's rights) raises serious
   ethical concerns, particularly regarding bias in news coverage. It also
   seems that Generative Artificial Intelligence tools are failing to
   replace the essential human qualities of emotion, empathy, and
   contextual understanding that journalists bring to their work. Finally,
   the Integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence into journalism is
   viewed both as an opportunity and a threat to various journalistic
   roles, such as online journalism and editing, yet it is perceived as
   inevitable in the journalism profession, much like in many other fields.},

Abstract = {Education is experiencing a paradigm shift, evolving from traditional
   learning methods to computer-tool-based education, and now toward the
   integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence. While classical
   methods offer structured and standardized learning, they often do not
   fully address individual learner needs and accessibility. The rise of
   digital technologies introduced adaptive learning platforms, online
   classrooms, and interactive educational tools, expanding the reach and
   flexibility of educational systems. Today, Generative Artificial
   Intelligence tools are redefining the education landscape by
   personalized learning experiences, automating content generation, and
   providing real-time feedback. Intelligent tutoring systems and
   personalized assessments empower students with customized learning
   pathways that enhance engagement and academic performance. This paper
   presents a meta-survey that systematically examines the role of
   Generative Artificial Intelligence in education, following PRISMA
   guidelines to analyze trends, frameworks, and research outcomes across a
   curated body of academic literature. Special attention is given to the
   emergence of commercial Generative Artificial Intelligence tools, which
   are increasingly embedded in learning environments. A structured
   comparison framework and research questions guide the review, offering
   insights into how Generative Artificial Intelligence technologies are
   shaping pedagogical practices, influencing assessment, and raising new
   ethical and technical challenges. The paper also explores future

   consist of two different stages while implementing the model. In the
   first stage, the essential dataset is assembled from the benchmark data
   source. These datasets are assembled by using Generative Artificial
   Intelligence (Gen Artificial Intelligence networks). Consequently, the
   raw data is given as an input to Conditional Hybrid Network for
   cybersecurity enhancement. Further, the Transformer-based Conditional
   Variational Autoencoders with Spatialtemporal Attention are designed for
   feature extraction that is subjected to the Conditional Generative
   Adversarial Network for classifying the cyber attacks. Henceforth, the

Abstract = {The Generative Adversarial Networks, as one of the most creative deep
   learning models in recent years, has achieved great success in computer
   vision and natural language processing. It uses the game theory to
   generate the best sample in generator and discriminator. Recently, many

Abstract = {Quantum computing and artificial intelligence, combined together, may
   revolutionize future technologies. A significant school of thought
   regarding artificial intelligence is based on generative models. Here,
   we propose a general quantum algorithm for machine learning based on a
   quantum generative model. We prove that our proposed model is more
   capable of representing probability distributions compared with
   classical generative models and has exponential speedup in learning and
   inference at least for some instances if a quantum computer cannot be
   efficiently simulated classically. Our result opens a new direction for
   quantum machine learning and offers a remarkable example where a quantum
   algorithm shows exponential improvement over classical algorithms in an
   important application field.},

Abstract = {Building intelligent systems that are capable of extracting high-level
   representations from high-dimensional sensory data lies at the core of
   solving many artificial intelligence-related tasks, including object
   recognition, speech perception, and language understanding. Theoretical
   and biological arguments strongly suggest that building such systems
   requires models with deep architectures that involve many layers of
   nonlinear processing. In this article, we review several popular deep
   learning models, including deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann
   machines. We show that (a) these deep generative models, which contain
   many layers of latent variables and millions of parameters, can be
   learned efficiently, and (b) the learned high-level feature
   representations can be successfully applied in many application domains,
   including visual object recognition, information retrieval,
   classification, and regression tasks.},

Abstract = {Traditional nursing and health education design courses usually only
   transfer knowledge via lectures, and lack interaction, drills and
   personalized feedback. However, the development and widespread adoption
   of generative artificial intelligence via the ChatGPT system presents an
   opportunity to address these issues. Some CIDI model-based ChatGPT
   systems have been developed, but how to effectively apply these
   technologies in nursing education design courses remains a challenging
   problem for researchers. In order to explore the application mode and
   effect of generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT technology in
   nursing education, this study integrated generative artificial
   intelligence via the ChatGPT system into the teaching activities of
   nursing and health education design courses, and used computers as
   learning tools to guide learners to learn nursing and health knowledge.
   At the same time, two classes of nursing undergraduates were recruited
   to conduct a quasi-experiment. One of the classes was the experimental
   group, which used the generative artificial intelligence via the ChatGPT
   system for learning; the other class was the control group, which used
   traditional teaching methods for learning. By analyzing learners'
   learning efficiency and learning satisfaction, we obtained results about
   the application effect of generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT
   technology in a nursing education design course. According to the
   experimental results, the generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT
   system effectively improved learners' critical thinking ability, problem
   solving, and learning enjoyment. These results indicate that the
   generative artificial intelligence via ChatGPT system has great
   potential in nursing education design courses, and can improve the
   deficiencies of traditional teaching methods.},

Journal = {BIG DATA \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In addition to tapping data from users' behavioral surplus, by drawing
   on generative adversarial networks, data for artificial intelligence is
   now increasingly being generated through artificial intelligence. With
   this new method of producing data synthetically, the data economy is not
   only shifting from ``data collection{''} to ``data generation.{''}
   Synthetic data is also being employed to address some of the most
   pressing ethical concerns around artificial intelligence. It thereby
   comes with the sociotechnical imaginary that social problems can be cut
   out of artificial intelligence, separating training data from real
   persons. In response to this technical solutionism, this commentary aims
   to initiate a critical debate about synthetic data that goes beyond
   misuse scenarios such as the use of generative adversarial networks to
   create deep fakes or dark patterns. Instead, on a more general level, we
   seek to complicate the idea of ``solving,{''} i.e., ``closing{''} and
   thus ``silencing{''} the ethico-political debates for which synthetic
   data is supposed to be a solution by showing how synthetic data itself
   is political. Drawing on the complex connections between recent uses of
   synthetic data and public debates about artificial intelligence, we
   therefore propose to consider and analyze synthetic data not only as a
   technical device but as a discursive one as well. To this end, we shed
   light on their relationship to three pillars that we see associated with
   them (a) algorithmic bias, (b) privacy, (c) platform economy.},

Abstract = {This study aims to examine how generative artificial intelligence
   adoption and perceived artificial intelligence capacities influence
   sustainability-oriented entrepreneurial intentions through psychological
   mechanisms, including perceived desirability and feasibility. Despite
   growing research interest in sustainability-oriented entrepreneurship,
   the role of technological enablers, particularly artificial
   intelligence, in shaping entrepreneurial intentions has been
   underexplored. To achieve this objective, an advanced
   approach-polynomial regression with response surface analysis-was
   employed to test the formulated hypotheses using data from 385
   participants. The study further shows that sustainability-oriented
   entrepreneurial intentions improve significantly when perceived
   desirability and feasibility are aligned but remain unaffected by
   misalignment. Generative artificial intelligence adoption and perceived
   artificial intelligence capacities are shown to directly and indirectly
   enhance entrepreneurial intentions through perceived desirability and
   feasibility, highlighting the dual role of artificial intelligence as a
   practical enabler and psychological motivator. These findings contribute
   to the extent of entrepreneurial literature by indicating how artificial
   intelligence technologies foster sustainability-oriented
   entrepreneurship. Moreover, these findings provide valuable insights for
   policymakers, educators, and organizations by demonstrating how
   artificial intelligence can be leveraged to promote sustainable

   better support the development of sustainability-oriented entrepreneurs

Abstract = {Today, various types of artificial intelligence (AI) are emerging as
   potential information and communication technologies (ICTs) to be

   impacts of AI on public service delivery (Battaglini et al., 2022;
   Meijer \& Wessels, 2019) and bureaucratic decision-making (Bullock,
   2019; Young et al., 2019). Yet little is understood regarding public
   employees-generative AI interactions and how these interactions affect
   work outcomes. Street-level bureaucrats make decisions with considerable
   discretion, while they interact with the public (Lipsky, 1980). While AI
   can be utilized as a tool by street-level bureaucrats, it also may
   eliminate human roles and stand in as an ``artificial bureaucrat{''}
   (Bullock \& Kim, 2020). The integration of generative AI may shape
   employees' role identities, which in turn affect their psychosocial
   outcomes. We develop a theoretical framework that investigates how
   human-generative- AI interactions affect street-level bureaucrats' work
   outcomes. The framework focuses on two main components: (1) the extent
   to which generative AI takes part at work; and (2) how human-generative
   AI interactions shape street-level bureaucrats role identity and their
   psychosocial outcomes. We integrate literature about workplace identity
   and job demands-resources theory to provide a set of propositions that
   can be applied in public organizations.},

   Model-Generated Text in the Nursing Literature},
Journal = {CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {All disciplines, including nursing, may be experiencing significant
   changes with the advent of free, publicly available generative
   artificial intelligence tools. Recent research has shown the difficulty
   in distinguishing artificial intelligence-generated text from content
   that is written by humans, thereby increasing the probability for
   unverified information shared in scholarly works. The purpose of this
   study was to determine the extent of generative artificial intelligence
   usage in published nursing articles. The Dimensions database was used to
   collect articles with at least one appearance of words and phrases
   associated with generative artificial intelligence. These articles were
   then searched for words or phrases known to be disproportionately
   associated with large language model-based generative artificial
   intelligence. Several nouns, verbs, adverbs, and phrases had remarkable
   increases in appearance starting in 2023, suggesting use of generative
   artificial intelligence. Nurses, authors, reviewers, and editors will
   likely encounter generative artificial intelligence in their work.
   Although these sophisticated and emerging tools are promising, we must
   continue to work toward developing ways to verify accuracy of their
   content, develop policies that insist on transparent use, and safeguard
   consumers of the evidence they generate.},

Abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into

   pretrained transformer (GPT)-4, GPT-4o, and the Trained-GPT model.
   Results demonstrate that the Trained-GPT achieved grading accuracy and
   consistency comparable to human teachers, with strong correlations
   observed in Mathematics (0.996) and English (0.874). While GPT-4o
   performed well in specific cases, its variability highlights areas for
   improvement. These findings underscore the potential of AI-powered
   teaching assistants to streamline grading, deliver timely feedback, and

Abstract = {Systematic review is a powerful tool for disseminating the findings of
   research, particularly in applied linguistics where we hope to provide
   insights for practising language teachers. Yet, systematic review is
   also often prohibitively time-consuming, particularly for small,
   underfunded teams or solo researchers. In this study, we explore the use
   of generative artificial intelligence to ease the burden of screening
   and organising papers. Our findings suggest that AI excels in some
   tasks, particularly when those tasks involve explicitly stated
   information, and struggles in others, particularly when information is
   more implicit. A comparison of generative artificial intelligence for
   filtering papers with ASReview, a popular non-generative tool, reveals
   trade-offs, with Generative AI being replicable and more efficient, but
   with concerns about accuracy. We conclude that generative artificial
   intelligence can be a useful tool for systematic review but requires
   rigorous validation before use. We conclude by emphasising the
   importance of testing AI for systematic review tasks and exploring how
   this can practically be achieved.},

   iconic creation, in the context of various cultural and communication
   theories, sociosemiotics emerges as a key framework for understanding
   these processes. The article addresses questions such as: How have the
   relationships between AI research and sociosemiotics evolved? How can
   sociosemiotics contribute to the understanding of GenAI? If Umberto Eco
   (1986) distinguished between general semiotics and specific (or applied)
   semiotics, what would be the main characteristics of a semiotics of
   Generative AI? In this context, the article's objectives encompass three
   dimensions: 1) Tracing the intertwined evolution of sociosemiotics and
   AI research over 75 years, spotlighting the textual and sociosemiotics
   contributions; 2) Proposing a series of possible sociosemiotic
   interventions in the realm of GenAI; and 3) Reflecting on the emergence
   of an applied semiotics of GenAI. Ultimately, the article encapsulates
   the intricate interplay between sociosemiotics and GenAI, paving the way

   research area, to the best of the authors' knowledge, based on searches
   conducted in academic databases, no bibliometric analysis on artificial
   intelligence (AI) for the IoMT has been conducted. To address this gap,
   this study proposes performing a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of
   AI applications in the IoMT. A bibliometric analysis of top literature
   sources, main disciplines, countries, prolific authors, trending topics,
   authorship, citations, author-keywords, and co-keywords was conducted.
   In addition, the structural development of AI in the IoMT highlights its
   growing popularity. This study found that security and privacy issues
   are serious concerns hindering the massive adoption of the IoMT. Future
   research directions on the IoMT, including perspectives on artificial
   general intelligence, generative artificial intelligence, and
   explainable artificial intelligence, have been outlined and discussed.},

   a `co-pilot' for human analysts. Notwithstanding issues of inaccuracy,
   imported bias and `hallucination', generative AI can liberate time-poor
   analysts to focus on tasks where humans add most value - applying their
   expertise, tacit knowledge and `sense of reality'.},

Abstract = {The fundamental goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to mimic the
   core cognitive activities of human. Despite tremendous success in the AI
   research, most of existing methods have only single-cognitive ability.
   To overcome this limitation and take a solid step towards artificial
   general intelligence (AGI), we develop a foundation model pre-trained
   with huge multimodal data, which can be quickly adapted for various
   downstream cognitive tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose to
   pre-train our foundation model by self-supervised learning with weak
   semantic correlation data crawled from the Internet and show that
   promising results can be obtained on a wide range of downstream tasks.
   Particularly, with the developed model-interpretability tools, we
   demonstrate that strong imagination ability is now possessed by our
   foundation model. We believe that our work makes a transformative stride
   towards AGI, from our common practice of ``weak or narrow AI{''} to that
   of ``strong or generalized AI{''}.
   Artificial intelligence approaches inspired by human cognitive function
   have usually single learned ability. The authors propose a multimodal
   foundation model that demonstrates the cross-domain learning and
   adaptation for broad range of downstream cognitive tasks.},

Abstract = {As a consequence of technological progress, nowadays, one is used to the
   availability of big data generated in nearly all fields of science.
   However, the analysis of such data possesses vast challenges. One of
   these challenges relates to the explainability of methods from
   artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning. Currently, many of
   such methods are nontransparent with respect to their working mechanism
   and for this reason are called black box models, most notably deep
   learning methods. However, it has been realized that this constitutes
   severe problems for a number of fields including the health sciences and
   criminal justice and arguments have been brought forward in favor of an
   explainable AI (XAI). In this paper, we do not assume the usual
   perspective presenting XAI as it should be, but rather provide a
   discussion what XAIcan be. The difference is that we do not present
   wishful thinking but reality grounded properties in relation to a
   scientific theory beyond physics. This article is categorized under:

Abstract = {Given the potential applications of generative AI (GenAI) in education
   and its rising interest in research, this systematic review mapped the
   thematic landscape of 407 publications indexed in the Web of Science,
   ScienceDirect and Scopus. Using EPPI Reviewer, publication type,
   educational level, disciplines, research areas and applications of GenAI
   were extracted. Eight discursive themes were identified, predominantly
   focused on `application, impact and potential', `ethical implication and
   risks', `perspectives and experiences', `institutional and individual
   adoption', and `performance and intelligence'. GenAI was conceptualised
   as a tool for `pedagogical enhancement', `specialised training and
   practices', `writing assistance and productivity', `professional skills
   and development', and as an `interdisciplinary learning tool'. Key gaps
   highlighted include a paucity of research and discussions on GenAI in
   K-12 education; a limited exploration of GenAI's impact using
   experimental procedures; and a limited exploration of the potential and
   ethical concerns of GenAI from the lens of cultural dimensions.

Abstract = {In the history of the quest for human-level artificial intelligence, a
   number of rival paradigms have vied for supremacy. Symbolic artificial
   intelligence was dominant for much of the 20th century, but currently a
   connectionist paradigm is in the ascendant, namely machine learning with
   deep neural networks. However, both paradigms have strengths and
   weaknesses, and a significant challenge for the field today is to effect
   a reconciliation. A central tenet of the symbolic paradigm is that
   intelligence results from the manipulation of abstract compositional
   representations whose elements stand for objects and relations. If this
   is correct, then a key objective for deep learning is to develop
   architectures capable of discovering objects and relations in raw data,
   and learning how to represent them in ways that are useful for
   downstream processing. This short review highlights recent progress in
   this direction.},

Abstract = {Despite enormous progress in machine learning, artificial neural
   networks still lag behind brains in their ability to generalize to new
   situations. Given identical training data, differences in generalization
   are caused by many defining features of a learning algorithm, such as
   network architecture and learning rule. Their joint effect, called
   ``inductive bias,'' determines how well any learning algorithm-or
   brain-generalizes: robust generalization needs good inductive biases.
   Artificial networks use rather nonspecific biases and often latch onto
   patterns that are only informative about the statistics of the training
   data but may not generalize to different scenarios. Brains, on the other
   hand, generalize across comparatively drastic changes in the sensory
   input all the time. We highlight some shortcomings of state-of-the-art
   learning algorithms compared to biological brains and discuss several
   ideas about how neuroscience can guide the quest for better inductive
   biases by providing useful constraints on representations and network
   architecture.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence are encouraging governments

   methods to be robust to both the known unknowns (those uncertain aspects

   unknown unknowns (those aspects of the world that are not captured by
   the system's models). This article discusses recent progress in AI and
   then describes eight ideas related to robustness that are being pursued
   within the AI research community. While these ideas are a start, we need
   to devote more attention to the challenges of dealing with the known and

Abstract = {Machine learned generative design is an extension of the generative
   design process, addressing its inherent limitations, particularly those
   of interoperability. The proposed approach uses machine learning -based
   surrogate models, trained on computational model data, to replicate
   design evaluations and integrate them into a common environment. In this
   way, design alternatives can be generated and tested that satisfy all
   design requirements and considerations. The effectiveness of this
   approach is demonstrated by the design and optimisation of the enclosure
   structure for the New Robotic Telescope. Its complexity is characterised
   by multiple operating states that the enclosure can assume, in
   particular the closed state and the opening/closing state, each of which
   has a different structural behaviour. Using our approach, the results
   from each state were replicated with machine learning models and
   combined into a single evaluation model. This resulted in finding
   multiple solutions that outperformed the benchmark design. The results
   demonstrate not only the success of our method over conventional
   strategies, but also highlight its potential to redefine future design
   optimisation processes.},

Abstract = {Neural generative models can be used to learn complex probability
   distributions from data, to sample from them, and to produce probability
   density estimates. We propose a computational framework for developing
   neural generative models inspired by the theory of predictive processing
   in the brain. According to predictive processing theory, the neurons in
   the brain form a hierarchy in which neurons in one level form
   expectations about sensory inputs from another level. These neurons
   update their local models based on differences between their
   expectations and the observed signals. In a similar way, artificial
   neurons in our generative models predict what neighboring neurons will
   do, and adjust their parameters based on how well the predictions
   matched reality. In this work, we show that the neural generative models
   learned within our framework perform well in practice across several
   benchmark datasets and metrics and either remain competitive with or
   significantly outperform other generative models with similar
   functionality (such as the variational auto-encoder).
   Brain-inspired neural generative models can be designed to learn complex
   probability distributions from data. Here the authors propose a neural
   generative computational framework, inspired by the theory of predictive

   the gains from AI adoption are largest for moderately rare problems,
   where human agents have less baseline experience but the system still

Journal = {COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {51},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In less than one year from its launch, the chatbot ChatGPT has captured
   widespread public attention, thanks to its ease of use and remarkable
   performance. However, part of this interest is due to its involvement in
   some data protection and data security issues. In the context of the
   ongoing debate surrounding similar technologies, such as generative AI,
   this contribution will first introduce the ``ChatGPT phenomenon{''}
   (Sections 1 and 2). Then, it will analyse the various positions taken by
   some key stakeholders on the issues of above and the regulation of the
   design and use of such technologies, examining these perspectives
   through the lenses of ``Digital Constitutionalism{''}. Particularly,
   this paper will emphasise the role that civil society can play in such
   dynamics (Section 3). Subsequently, it will further promote an active
   and forward-looking approach in addressing the looming threats these and
   other AI-based technologies could pose to fundamental rights and society
   as a whole (Section 4). As we already approach the next AI era without
   even noticing, the question worth asking ourselves is: ``What will
   generative and AI-powered oracles reveal about us?{''} (Section 5).},

Title = {Rewriting a Generative Model with Out-of-Domain Patterns},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can synthesize images with the
   same distribution as the training dataset through random vectors.
   However, there is still no proper way to explain the generation rules in
   the generator and modify those rules. Although there have been some
   works on rewriting the rules in generative models in recent years, these
   works mainly focus on rewriting the rules between the patterns it has
   already learned. In this paper, we cast the problem of rewriting as
   rewriting the rule in the generator with out-of-domain patterns. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first time this problem has been
   investigated. To address this problem, we propose the Re-Generator
   framework. Specifically, our method projects out-of-domain images into
   the feature space of a specific layer in the generator and designs a
   mechanism to enable the generator to decode that feature back to the
   original image as possible. Besides that, we also suggest viewing
   multiple layers of the model as nonlinearity associative memory and
   design a rewriting strategy with better performance based on this.
   Finally, the results of the experiments on various generative models in
   multiple datasets show that our method can effectively use the patterns
   that the model has never seen before as rules for rewriting.},

Journal = {COMPUTER SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Generative models have been in existence for many decades. In the field
   of machine learning, we come across many scenarios when directly
   learning a target is intractable through discriminative models, and in
   such cases the joint distribution of the target and the training data is
   approximated and generated. These generative models help us better
   represent or model a set of data by generating data in the form of
   Markov chains or simply employing a generative iterative process to do
   the same. With the recent innovation of Generative Adversarial Networks
   (GANs), it is now possible to make use of AI to generate pieces of art,
   music, etc. with a high extent of realism. In this paper, we review and
   analyse critically all the generative models, namely Gaussian Mixture
   Models (GMM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Latent Dirichlet Allocation
   (LDA), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), Deep Belief Networks (DBN),
   Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), and GANs. We study their algorithms and
   implement each of the models to provide the reader some insights on
   which generative model to pick from while dealing with a problem. We
   also provide some noteworthy contributions done in the past to these
   models from the literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Among the many types of deep models, deep generative models (DGMs)
   provide a solution to the important problem of unsupervised and

   experience, and know-how because their training is more complex than
   other types of deep models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
   We develop a visual analytics approach for better understanding and
   diagnosing the training process of a DGM. To help experts understand the
   overall training process, we first extract a large amount of time series
   data that represents training dynamics (e.g., activation changes over
   time). A blue-noise polyline sampling scheme is then introduced to
   select time series samples, which can both preserve outliers and reduce
   visual clutter. To further investigate the root cause of a failed
   training process; we propose a credit assignment algorithm that
   indicates how other neurons contribute to the output of the neuron
   causing the training failure. Two case studies are conducted with
   machine learning experts to demonstrate how our approach helps
   understand and diagnose the training processes of DGMs. We also show how
   our approach can be directly used to analyze other types of deep models
   such as CNNs.},

Abstract = {Amortized variational inference, whereby the inferred latent variable
   posterior distributions are parameterized by means of neural network
   functions, has invigorated a new wave of innovation in the field of
   generative latent variable modeling, giving rise to the family of deep
   generative models (DGMs). Existing DGM formulations are based on the
   assumption of a symmetric Gaussian posterior over the model latent
   variables. This assumption, although mathematically convenient, can be
   well-expected to undermine the eventually obtained representation power,
   as it imposes apparent expressiveness limitations. Indeed, it has been
   recently shown that even some moderate increase in the latent variable
   posterior expressiveness, obtained by introducing an additional level of
   dependencies upon auxiliary (Gaussian) latent variables, can result in
   significant performance improvements in the context of semi-supervised
   learning tasks. Inspired from these advances, in this paper we examine
   whether a more potent increase in the expressiveness and representation
   power of modern DGMs can be achieved by completely relaxing their
   typical symmetric (Gaussian) latent variable posterior assumptions:
   Specifically, we consider DGMs with asymmetric posteriors, formulated as
   restricted multivariate skew-Normal (rMSN) distributions. We derive an
   efficient amortized variational inference algorithm for the proposed
   model, and exhibit its superiority over the current state-of-the-art in
   several semi-supervised learning benchmarks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Absract Deep learning is currently the most prominent and widely
   successful method in artificial intelligence. Despite having played an
   active role in earlier artificial intelligence and neural network
   research, philosophers have been largely silent on this technology so
   far. This is remarkable, given that deep learning neural networks have
   blown past predicted upper limits on artificial intelligence
   performance-recognizing complex objects in natural photographs and
   defeating world champions in strategy games as complex as Go and
   chess-yet there remains no universally accepted explanation as to why
   they work so well. This article provides an introduction to these
   networks as well as an opinionated guidebook on the philosophical
   significance of their structure and achievements. It argues that deep
   learning neural networks differ importantly in their structure and
   mathematical properties from the shallower neural networks that were the
   subject of so much philosophical reflection in the 1980s and 1990s. The
   article then explores several different explanations for their success
   and ends by proposing three areas of inquiry that would benefit from
   future engagement by philosophers of mind and science.},

Abstract = {Although machine learning has been successful in recent years and is

   philosophy of mathematics and machine learning. The present contribution
   addresses the resulting lack of conceptual tools for an epistemological
   discussion of machine learning by conceiving of deep learning networks
   as `judging machines' and using the Kantian analysis of judgments for
   specifying the type of judgment they are capable of. At the center of
   the argument is the fact that the functionality of deep learning
   networks is established by training and cannot be explained and
   justified by reference to a predefined rule-based procedure. Instead,
   the computational process of a deep learning network is barely
   explainable and needs further justification, as is shown in reference to
   the current research literature. Thus, it requires a new form of
   justification, that is to be specified with the help of Kant's
   epistemology.},

   between humans and AI systems could exist. That would require
   reciprocity, which is beyond the reach of near-future AI systems.
   Rather, we defend the claim that social AIs should be programmed to
   behave in a manner thatmimicsa sufficient number of aspects of proper
   friendship. We call this ``as-if friendship{''}. The main reason for why
   we believe that `as if friendship' is an improvement on the current,
   highly submissive behavior displayed by AIs is the negative effects the
   latter can have on humans. We defend this view partly on virtue ethical
   grounds and we argue that the virtue-based approach to AI ethics

   improvement on the traditional ``value alignment{''} approach.},

   Predictors of Fears Towards GenAI},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 OCT 30},
Abstract = {This study developed and validated the Fears Towards Generative
   Artificial Intelligence scale, a novel instrument assessing individuals'
   concerns about emerging generative AI technologies, which are
   increasingly integrated into daily life. Drawing on qualitative data
   from three focus groups and subsequent quantitative validation with 303
   participants, we initially derived 37 items that captured diverse fears,
   including concerns about job displacement, social inequalities, and loss
   of human autonomy commonly associated with generative AI systems.
   Exploratory factor analyses supported a unidimensional structure of the
   scale, demonstrating strong reliability and content validity. Regression
   models revealed that negative attitudes towards AI and perceived threats
   to employment were key predictors of heightened fear, while greater
   usage and familiarity were linked to reduced fear. We also present a
   short 4-item version of the scale generated by a genetic algorithm and
   tested with 101 new participants, which presents good psychometric
   properties. The FTGAI scale addresses a critical measurement gap and
   offers a comprehensive tool for researchers and policymakers seeking to
   understand and mitigate fears towards generative AI's growing societal
   impact.},

Abstract = {The launch of ChatGPT in 2022 garnered global attention, marking a
   significant milestone in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)
   field. While GAI has been in effect for the past decade, the
   introduction of ChatGPT sparked a new wave of research and innovation in
   the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain. This surge has led to the
   development and release of numerous cutting-edge tools, such as Bard,
   Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Make-A-Video, Runway ML, and Jukebox, among
   others. These tools exhibit remarkable capabilities, encompassing tasks
   ranging from text generation and music composition, image creation,
   video production, code generation, and even scientific work. They are
   built upon various state-of-the-art models, including Stable Diffusion,
   transformer models like GPT-3 (recent GPT-4), variational autoencoders,
   and generative adversarial networks. This advancement in GAI presents a
   wealth of exciting opportunities across various sectors, such as
   business, healthcare, education, entertainment, and media. However,
   concurrently, it poses unprecedented challenges such as impersonation,
   job displacement, privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, and
   misinformation. To addressing these challenges requires a new direction
   for research to develop solutions and refine existing products. In our
   endeavor to contribute profound insights to society and advance research
   on GAI, we present a comprehensive journal which explores the
   theoretical and mathematical foundations of GAI state-of-the-art models,
   exploring the diverse spectrum of tasks they can perform, examining the
   challenges they entail, and discussing the promising prospects for the
   future of GAI.},

Abstract = {In this article, we employ the prism of technological acceleration to
   consider how Generative AI may impact the spatial-temporal dimensions of
   diplomacy, and what ramifications this transformation may hold for its
   practice. To do so, we distinguish between Horizontal Acceleration,
   which relates to the number of diplomatic domains that are progressively
   impacted by the introduction of a new digital technology, and Vertical
   Acceleration, which relates to how ripple effects reverberate within the
   diplomatic domain and how deeply. Next, we outline three possible
   scenarios in which Generative AI leads to minimal or maximal horizontal
   and vertical acceleration. In the Dedalus scenario, Generative AI's
   impact is confined to a few domains, predominantly influencing
   diplomats' daily routines. In the Heracles scenario, Generative AI
   systems interact with one another rendering human diplomats as mere
   messengers. We coin this outcome as `the end of diplomacy.' Finally, we
   anticipate that many MFAs may position themselves between these two
   poles in the Pygmalion scenario.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence in medical imaging has grown rapidly in the past
   decade, driven by advances in deep learning and widespread access to

Abstract = {The speckle is a granular undesired pattern present in

   field of research during the last decades, with approaches from local
   filters to non-local filters that calculate the new value of a pixel
   according to characteristics of other pixels that are not close, the
   more advanced paradigms based on deep learning, and the newer based on
   generative artificial intelligence. For the latter, it is necessary to
   have a large enough labeled dataset for training and validation. In this
   study, we propose using a dataset designed entirely from actual SAR
   imagery, calculated by multitemporal fusion operations to generate a
   ground truth reference, which will yield the models to be trained with
   the actual speckle patterns in the noisy images. Then, a comparative
   analysis of the impacts of including the generative capacity in the
   models is performed through visual and quantitative assessment. From the
   findings, it is concluded that the use of generative artificial

Abstract = {Objective: Information retrieval (IR, also known as search) systems are
   ubiquitous in modern times. How does the emergence of generative
   artificial intelligence (AI), based on large language models (LLMs), fit
   into the IR process? Process: This perspective explores the use of
   generative AI in the context of the motivations, considerations, and
   outcomes of the IR process with a focus on the academic use of such
   systems. Conclusions: There are many information needs, from simple to
   complex, that motivate use of IR. Users of such systems, particularly
   academics, have concerns for authoritativeness, timeliness, and
   contextualization of search. While LLMs may provide functionality that
   aids the IR process, the continued need for search systems, and research
   into their improvement, remains essential.},

Journal = {COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {55},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The rapid advancements in natural language processing, particularly the
   development of generative large language models (LLMs), have renewed
   interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for judicial
   decision-making. While these technological breakthroughs present new
   possibilities for legal automation, they also raise concerns about
   over-reliance and automation bias. Drawing insights from the COMPAS
   case, this paper examines the implications of deploying generative LLMs
   in the judicial domain. It identifies the persistent factors that
   contributed to an accountability gap when AI systems were previously
   used for judicial decision-making. To address these risks, the paper
   analyses the relevant provisions of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act,
   outlining a comprehensive accountability framework based on the
   regulation's risk-based approach. The paper concludes that the
   successful integration of generative LLMs in judicial decision-making
   requires a holistic approach addressing cognitive biases. By emphasising
   shared responsibility and the imperative of AI literacy across the AI
   value chain, the regulatory framework can help mitigate the risks of
   automation bias and preserve the rule of law.},

Abstract = {Spurred by the launch of transformer models like GPT, generative AI

   identifies two core features that turn generative AI into an exciting
   topic and instrument for psychological research: the scope of use cases
   and the ability to create human-like output. Against this background,
   the paper discusses potential implications for psychological research in
   three areas. First, we observe a burgeoning trend to analyze the
   abilities of generative AI from a psychological perspective. The
   overarching question in this field is whether the output and behavior of
   generative AI exhibit human-like properties. Second, psychological
   research will play an essential role in assessing the impact of
   generative AI on humans. Key questions are about how generative AI can
   be used deceptively, how humans evaluate AI regarding competence or
   warmth, and how generative AI can be leveraged to foster
   knowledge-related processes in interaction with humans. Third, the
   process of psychological research itself is likely to change with
   generative AI. We discuss potential fields of application but also argue
   against some use cases (e. g., employing generative AI as a surrogate
   for participants in experiments). In all three research fields, the
   dualism between the lack of language understanding, coupled with an
   uncanny ability to (re)produce human-like language, is both a challenge
   for and a motivator of psychological research.},

Abstract = {Introduction Generative Artificial Intelligence has made significant
   impacts in many fields, including computational cognitive modeling of
   decision making, although these applications have not yet been
   theoretically related to each other. This work introduces a
   categorization of applications of Generative Artificial Intelligence to
   cognitive models of decision making.Methods This categorization is used
   to compare the existing literature and to provide insight into the
   design of an ablation study to evaluate our proposed model in three
   experimental paradigms. These experiments used for model comparison
   involve modeling human learning and decision making based on both visual
   information and natural language, in tasks that vary in realism and
   complexity. This comparison of applications takes as its basis
   Instance-Based Learning Theory, a theory of experiential decision making
   from which many models have emerged and been applied to a variety of
   domains and applications.Results The best performing model from the
   ablation we performed used a generative model to both create memory
   representations as well as predict participant actions. The results of
   this comparison demonstrates the importance of generative models in both
   forming memories and predicting actions in decision-modeling
   research.Discussion In this work, we present a model that integrates
   generative and cognitive models, using a variety of stimuli,
   applications, and training methods. These results can provide guidelines
   for cognitive modelers and decision making researchers interested in
   integrating Generative AI into their methods.},

Month = {2025 SEP 19},
Abstract = {In dental school clinics, students are increasingly using Generative

   This chairside, or point of care, use raises ethical concerns,

   ethics training. Using a utilitarian framework, the paper explores how
   GenAI can maximize benefits, such as consistency and efficiency, while
   minimizing harm when used appropriately. It emphasizes that faculty must
   guide students in GenAI use, and that patients should have the
   opportunity to provide informed consent when GenAI influences care.
   Responsibly incorporating GenAI in dental school clinics should prepare

Abstract = {The evolving field of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI),
   particularly generative deep learning, is revolutionizing a host of
   scientific and technological sectors. One of the pivotal innovations
   within this domain is the emergence of generative adversarial networks
   (GANs). These unique models have shown remarkable capabilities in
   crafting synthetic data, closely emulating real-world distributions.
   Notably, their application to gene expression data systems is a
   fascinating and rapidly growing focus area. Restrictions related to
   ethical and logistical issues often limit the size, diversity, and
   data-gathering speed of gene expression data. Herein lies the potential
   of GANs, as they are capable of producing synthetic gene expression
   data, offering a potential solution to these limitations. This review
   provides a thorough analysis of the most recent advancements at this
   innovative crossroads of GANs and gene expression data, specifically
   during the period from 2019 to 2023. In the context of the fast-paced
   progress in deep learning technologies, accurate and inclusive reviews
   of current practices are critical to guiding subsequent research
   efforts, sharing knowledge, and catalyzing continual growth in the
   discipline. This review, through highlighting recent studies and seminal

Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools has reshaped
   the academic integrity landscape, introducing new challenges to
   maintaining honesty in scholarly work. Unlike traditional plagiarism,
   which typically involves copying existing text, generative artificial
   intelligence-generated content often appears sufficiently original to
   evade detection systems. This underscores the necessity of investigating
   the factors that contribute to such misconduct. This study explores the
   factors associated with Generative AI academic misconduct among
   university students in Taiwan, focusing on personality traits from the
   Dark Tetrad-Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and
   sadism-alongside other personal attribute variables. Data were collected
   from 812 participants (Meanage = 24.86), comprising 439 females and 373

   results indicate that narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism significantly
   are significantly associated with Generative AI academic misconduct,
   while gender, educational level, grade point average, and
   Machiavellianism are not significant associated factors. These findings
   highlight the limited relevance of traditional personal attributes as

   was asked to write reports like forensic medicine specialists. In the
   retrospective phase, 100 forensic cases were assessed by Chat Generative
   Pre-Trained Transformer-4, while in the prospective phase, 266 new cases
   were assessed by both Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer-4 and
   forensic medicine assistants. Two forensic medicine specialists assessed
   the accuracy of these reports in terms of adherence to the forensic
   medicine guide.ResultsChat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer-4 achieved
   an accuracy rate of 96.6\% in the retrospective phase and 96.2\% in the
   prospective phase for the combined categories of ``Life-threatening{''}
   and ``Simple Medical Intervention{''}. Forensic medicine assistants,
   however, demonstrated a higher accuracy rate of 99.1\% in these
   categories compared to Chat Generative Pre-Trained

Abstract = {Since late 2022, access to Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI)
   such as ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini has become more widespread. This new
   phenomenon raises questions about the real impact of Gen-AI, including
   Large Language Models (LLM), especially on learning. Although we are
   facing a quite new phenomenon, a better understanding of the impact of
   Gen-AI on learning can be suggested by considering how other forms of
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been studied. Based on a systematic
   review approach, our study shows that most existing researches focus on
   the evaluation of AI that is dedicated to education (AIED), and do not
   consider AI devices designed for broader applications. Above all, the
   systematic review identifies more than forty indicators used in the
   assessments of the impact of AI on learning; indicators that can be
   grouped into six key dimensions: technological, learning achievement,
   pedagogical, interaction, affective, metacognitive. This provides a
   relevant framework and a solid basis for future evaluations of the
   impact of Gen-AI on learning.},

   application to AI, the paper asserts that these machines reveal a
   machinic essence intrinsic to human beings - our reliance on external
   cognitive aids and hybridization with the environment that makes us
   ``natural-born cyborgs.{''} Indeed AI, far from merely simulating

   tested empirically using online survey-based data collected from 260
   managers and administrative employees located in the Jordanian retailing
   industry. To achieve the objectives of this work a covariance-based-
   structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) was employed. The results
   indicate that relative advantage, top management support, organizational
   readiness, and customer pressures positively influence GEN-AI adoption.
   The empirical results demonstrated that the influence of compatibility
   and competitive pressures on GEN-AI adoption are insignificant. It was
   found that complexity negatively influence of GEN-AI adoption, also the
   findings confirm the positive impact of GEN-AI on both exploratory and
   exploitative innovation. The findings of the existing research would be
   valuable for GEN-AI technology providers, managers and top management in

Abstract = {The recent success of large language models (LLMs) in performing natural
   language processing tasks has increased interest in applying generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) to scientific research. However, a common
   problem of LLMs is their tendency to produce inaccurate and sometimes
   ``hallucinated{''} outputs. Here, we established a generative AI tool,
   NanoSafari, to automatically extract knowledge from the biomedical
   nanoscience literature and address scientific queries. We developed the
   Grouped Iterative Validation based Information Extraction (GIVE) method
   to extract contextual information on nanoparticle characteristics from
   >20,000 published articles and established a database that was
   incorporated into the generative LLM to provide accurate nanomaterial
   design parameters. Blinded evaluation by biomedical nanoscientists
   showed that NanoSafari outperformed the baseline model in providing more
   reliable parameters for nanomaterial design tasks, as further validated
   by bench experiments. Together, these findings demonstrate the utility
   of AI-based methods for automated learning from ``real-world{''}
   published work to provide accurate and reliable scientific references
   for biomaterial and bioengineering applications.},

   enhances entrepreneurial intention through self-efficacy and university
   support},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {This study investigates how Generative Artificial Intelligence Supported
   Entrepreneurship Education (GAISEE) influences university students'
   entrepreneurial intentions through a quantitative analysis of Chinese
   higher education institutions. Using structural equation modeling with
   data from 346 university students, we demonstrate that GAISEE
   significantly enhances both entrepreneurial self-efficacy (beta = 0.523,
   p < 0.001) and entrepreneurial intention (beta = 0.244, p < 0.001). The
   research reveals that entrepreneurial self-efficacy mediates the
   relationship between GAISEE and entrepreneurial intention, while the
   university entrepreneurial environment moderates these relationships.
   Notably, an optimized university environment strengthens the positive
   effects of GAISEE on both entrepreneurial self-efficacy (beta = 0.333, p
   < 0.001) and entrepreneurial intention (beta = 0.207, p < 0.001). These
   findings provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of integrating
   generative AI technology in entrepreneurship education and highlight the
   importance of supportive university ecosystems in fostering student
   entrepreneurship.},

   Entrepreneurship: Insights from the Entrepreneurial Event Model},
Journal = {ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH JOURNAL},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 SEP 16},
Abstract = {The increasing integration of artificial intelligence into
   entrepreneurial activities has transformed how individuals engage with
   digital innovation. This study examines the correlation between the
   congruence and incongruence of innovative and routine use of generative
   artificial intelligence (ambidexterity) and digital entrepreneurial
   intention. Drawing on the entrepreneurial event model, polynomial
   regression, and response surface analysis, the study examines the
   congruence and incongruence between routine and innovative uses of
   generative artificial intelligence, capturing their complex interactions
   and joint effects. Data collected from 1,061 undergraduate students at
   Vietnamese universities revealed significant congruence effects, showing
   that alignment between high levels of routine and innovative uses
   enhances students' digital entrepreneurial intention, perceived
   desirability, and feasibility. Furthermore, the incongruence between
   these uses has a negative relationship with entrepreneurial outcomes.
   The study also confirms that perceived desirability and feasibility
   mediate the relationships between generative artificial intelligence use
   (routine and innovative) and digital entrepreneurial intention. These
   findings extend current understandings of how digital tools support
   entrepreneurship education, highlighting the importance of balancing
   exploitation (routine use) and exploration (innovative use).
   Practically, the results suggest that educators and policymakers should
   encourage students to simultaneously develop both routine and innovative
   competencies in generative artificial intelligence to nurture digital
   entrepreneurial aspirations effectively.},

Title = {Does Artificial Intelligence Cause Artificial Confidence? Generative
   Artificial Intelligence as an Emerging Social Referent},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 28},
Abstract = {As generative artificial intelligence (gen-AI) becomes more prevalent,
   it becomes increasingly important to understand how people
   psychologically respond to the content it explicitly creates. In this
   research, we demonstrate that exposure to gen-AI produced content can
   affect people's self-confidence at the same task through a social
   comparison process. Anchoring this research in the domain of creativity,
   we find that exposing people to creative content believed to have been
   created by gen-AI (vs. a human peer) increases people's self-confidence
   in their own relevant creative abilities. This effect emerges for jokes,
   stories, poetry, and visual art, and it can consequently increase
   people's willingness to attempt the activity-even though the greater
   confidence underscoring their actions might be unwarranted. We further
   show that these effects emerge because gen-AI is perceived as a lower
   social referent for creative endeavors, bolstering people's own
   self-perceptions. As a result, for domains in which gen-AI is perceived
   as an equal or greater social referent (i.e., in fact-based domains),
   the effects are attenuated. These findings have significant implications
   for understanding human-AI interactions, antecedents for creative
   self-confidence, and the known referents that people use for social
   comparison effects.},

   `How does GenAI work?', `What could GenAI be used for?', `What legal
   issues could arise from using a GenAI?'. To accomplish our goals, we
   first conduct a literature review to define artificial intelligence (AI)
   in general and GenAI in particular. Several lawsuits are chosen to
   illustrate the magnitude of the legal problems and to test the
   feasibility of possible solutions in both the national and EU legal

Abstract = {In this exploratory study, we investigate undergraduate students'
   engagement with generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) in proving
   mathematical statements. We selected six mathematical statements to
   conduct interviews with three students. We present the emergent
   framework, Students' Interactive Proving Experience with AI (SIPE-AI),
   which explains the processes of students' use of genAI in their proving
   and the factors influencing these processes. Our findings identify three
   factors that shape students' use of genAI: conceptions of proof,
   conceptions of genAI, and ethical considerations. The results suggest a
   need to guide undergraduate students in critically engaging with genAI
   tools, rather than passively accepting their outputs. We also discuss
   the implications of these findings for enhancing undergraduate
   mathematics education by fostering informed and critical use of genAI in
   mathematical proving.},

   like ChatGPT and Bard to aid researchers in content generation and idea
   enhancement. We explore the current state of transparency regarding
   generative AI use in nursing academic research journals, emphasizing the
   need for explicitly declaring the use of generative AI by authors in the
   manuscript. Out of 125 nursing studies journals, 37.6\% required
   explicit statements about generative AI use in their authors'
   guidelines. No significant differences in impact factors or journal
   categories were found between journals with and without such
   requirement. A similar evaluation of medicine, general and internal
   journals showed a lower percentage (14.5\%) including the information
   about generative AI usage. Declaring generative AI tool usage is crucial
   for maintaining the transparency and credibility in academic writing.
   Additionally, extending the requirement for AI usage declarations to
   journal reviewers can enhance the quality of peer review and combat
   predatory journals in the academic publishing landscape. Our study

Abstract = {Purpose: This analysis aims to propose guidelines for artificial
   intelligence (AI) research ethics in scientific publications, intending
   to inform publishers and academic institutional policies in order to
   guide them toward a coherent and consistent approach to AI research
   ethics. Methods: A literature-based thematic analysis was conducted. The
   study reviewed the publication policies of the top 10 journal publishers
   addressing the use of AI in scholarly publications as of October 2024.
   Thematic analysis using ATLAS.ti identified themes and subthemes across
   the documents, which were consolidated into proposed research ethics
   guidelines for using generative AI and AI-assisted tools in scholarly
   publications. Results: The analysis revealed inconsistencies among
   publishers' policies on AI use in research and publications. AI-assisted
   tools for grammar and formatting are generally accepted, but positions
   vary regarding generative AI tools used in pre-writing and research
   methods. Key themes identified include author accountability, human
   oversight, recognized and unrecognized uses of AI tools, and the
   necessity for transparency in disclosing AI usage. All publishers agree
   that AI tools cannot be listed as authors. Concerns involve biases,
   quality and reliability issues, compliance with intellectual property
   rights, and limitations of AI detection tools. Conclusion: The article
   highlights the significant knowledge gap and inconsistencies in
   guidelines for AI use in scientific research. There is an urgent need
   for unified ethical standards, and guidelines are proposed for
   distinguishing between the accepted use of AI-assisted tools and the
   cautious use of generative AI tools.},

Abstract = {The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
   been fueled by breakthroughs in large language models and applications
   across diverse domains, from creative content to scientific discovery.
   Its strength lies in modeling, simulating, and generating high-fidelity
   data. In diabetes care, generative AI enables solutions to challenges
   such as data scarcity, patient variability, and personalization. This
   article explores key deep generative models, including variational
   autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, transformers, and
   diffusion models applied to tabular, time series, image, and text data.
   These models enable synthetic patient data generation, dataset
   augmentation, glucose-insulin dynamics simulation, and the development
   of virtual coaches and digital twins. Despite these advances, challenges
   persist, including model instability, high data requirements, and output
   interpretability. This article reviews the current literature and
   outlines opportunities, limitations, and ethical considerations for the
   use of generative AI in diabetes healthcare.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the relationship between proactive
   personality and career-related decision-making self-efficacy, with
   generative artificial intelligence acceptance serving as a mediating
   factor. Additionally, the study examined the moderating effect of
   innovation competencies on this mediation pathway, utilizing a moderated
   mediation framework. The study included 501 university students from
   Guangdong Province, China, who completed validated measures of proactive
   personality, career-related decision-making self-efficacy, generative

   analysis was conducted using SPSS (Version 26) and the PROCESS macro to
   evaluate mediation, moderation, and moderated mediation effects.
   Moreover, confirmatory factor analysis was performed using Amos (Version
   28.0) to assess the validity of the measurement models. The results
   indicate that proactive personality exerts an indirect effect on
   career-related decision-making self-efficacy via generative artificial
   intelligence acceptance. The strength of this indirect effect was
   moderated by innovation competencies, indicating that the relationship
   is stronger at higher levels of innovation competencies. These findings
   contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between
   proactive personality and career-related decision-making self-efficacy,

   also explore the potential uses for GANs in ocular imaging, with a
   specific emphasis on 3 primary domains: image enhancement, disease
   identification, and generating of synthetic data. PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE,

   orbital magnetic resonance imaging, fundus photography, and ultrasound;
   however, we also highlight several challenges that resulted in the
   generation of inaccurate and atypical results during certain iterations.

   toward generative AI systems. To collect metrics on these attitudes, a
   five-point Likert Scale survey that was distributed to students enrolled
   in Clemson and Cal Poly graphic communication programs has been
   formulated. The data collected provided clarity that students have a
   high level of ethical apprehension toward generative AI systems despite

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 led to major controversies about the
   governance of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This article
   examines the first international governance and policy initiatives
   dedicated specifically to generative AI: the G7 Hiroshima process, the
   Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reports, and the
   UK AI Safety Summit. This analysis is informed by policy framing and
   governance literature, in particular by the work on technology
   governance and Responsible Innovation. Emerging governance of generative
   AI exhibits characteristics of polycentric governance, where multiple
   and overlapping centers of decision-making are in collaborative
   relationships. However, it is dominated by a limited number of developed
   countries. The governance of generative AI is mostly framed in terms of
   the risk management, largely neglecting issues of purpose and direction
   of innovation, and assigning rather limited roles to the public. We can
   see a ``paradox of generative AI governance{''} emerging, namely, that
   while this technology is being widely used by the public, its governance
   is rather narrow. This article coins the term ``governance fix{''} to
   capture this rather narrow and technocratic approach to governing
   generative AI. As an alternative, it suggests embracing the politics of
   polycentric governance and Responsible Innovation that highlight
   democratic and participatory co-shaping of technology for social
   benefit. In the context of the highly unequal distribution of power in
   generative AI characterized by a high concentration of power in a small
   number of large tech companies, the government has a special role in
   reshaping the power imbalances by enabling wide-ranging public
   participation in the governance of generative AI.},

Abstract = {Traditional decision-making frameworks are insufficient for managing the

   chain management and smart logistics within the paradigm of Industry
   5.0. An empirical case study conducted on Tepla Technology Corporation,

Title = {Generative Artificial Intelligence: Enhancing Patient Education in
   Cardiovascular Imaging},
Journal = {BJR OPEN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality worldwide,
   especially in resource-limited countries with limited access to
   healthcare resources. Early detection and accurate imaging are vital for
   managing CVD, emphasizing the significance of patient education.
   Generative artificial intelligence (AI), including algorithms to
   synthesize text, speech, images, and combinations thereof given a
   specific scenario or prompt, offers promising solutions for enhancing
   patient education. By combining vision and language models, generative
   AI enables personalized multimedia content generation through natural
   language interactions, benefiting patient education in cardiovascular
   imaging. Simulations, chat-based interactions, and voice-based
   interfaces can enhance accessibility, especially in resource-limited
   settings. Despite its potential benefits, implementing generative AI in
   resource-limited countries faces challenges like data quality,
   infrastructure limitations, and ethical considerations. Addressing these
   issues is crucial for successful adoption. Ethical challenges related to
   data privacy and accuracy must also be overcome to ensure better patient
   understanding, treatment adherence, and improved healthcare outcomes.
   Continued research, innovation, and collaboration in generative AI have
   the potential to revolutionize patient education. This can empower
   patients to make informed decisions about their cardiovascular health,
   ultimately improving healthcare outcomes in resource-limited settings.},

Abstract = {This study explored the perspectives of English instructors from Thai
   higher education institutions, with a focus on teachers' familiarity
   with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and its potential impact
   on teachers' professional roles and responsibilities. The results
   suggested that GenAI tools may allow English instructors to transition
   from traditional teachers to facilitators by using the tools to assist
   with both routine writing tasks and highlevel academic work. Meanwhile,
   it was found that instructors worried about possible over-reliance on
   GenAI. The participants emphasised that human instructors were still
   needed, although their roles needed to evolve. Significant gaps were
   identified in the competencies related to professional development,
   curriculum design, teacher training programmes, ethics, and
   responsibility. The findings may support the professional growth of
   current and future English instructors and facilitate the incorporation
   of GenAI in teaching practice. The findings also underscore the
   necessity of comprehensive GenAI training for pre- service teachers, the
   development of robust guidelines to navigate ethical challenges, and the
   examination of the impact of GenAI tools on student engagement and

Abstract = {Automated service agents with different levels of artificial

   increases perceptions of competence and warmth, and emotional AI
   improves all humanness cues. The article merges the research streams of

Abstract = {Highlights
   This review compares generative artificial intelligence with five
   representative educational technologies in history and concludes that AI
   technology can become a knowledge producer and thus can be utilized as
   educative AI to enhance teaching and learning outcomes.
   From a historical perspective, each technological breakthrough has
   affected education by changing how symbols are represented and how
   knowledge is carried.
   The emergence of new educational technology is always accompanied by
   doubt, vigilance, and rejection from the traditional community.
   The new educational technology, generative artificial intelligence,
   interacts with the old, creating an increasingly complex ecology of
   educational technology.
   Three suggestions are proposed for adjusting the education system:
   first, promoting small-scale, individualized, and conversational
   teaching in schools; second, developing teachers' and students' digital
   literacy in a multi-curricula system; and third, conducting research on
   grading and classification standards for the application of AI in
   education.},

Abstract = {The use of Generative Artificial Intelligence has raised concerns
   related to plagiarism in scientific contexts. However, bad academic
   writing is far from being the main ethical challenge related to digital
   transformations in knowledge production. Additionally, science is not
   the only trust discourse affected, as journalism and law are deeply
   impacted in its social roles by the dissemination of artificially

   digital society in a global context where colonial hierarchization,
   dehumanization and exploitation strategies are still in place. In
   response to the insufficiency of high-level moral principles before the
   ethical and Human Rights challenges brought by GenAI applications, this
   paper offers an alternative theoretical approach to digital ethics
   presented in the ``decolonizing ethical thinking{''} section. The aim is
   to focus on the role that the new epistemic dynamics play to the risk of
   technodigital colonialism. Decoloniality readings should account for why
   the benefits and risks are not universally distributed and therefore may
   help ethical responses be more attentive to the connections between

Journal = {LONDON REVIEW OF EDUCATION},

Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The rise of generative artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT is
   transforming how knowledge is produced, accessed and used across
   educational systems. While these technologies offer new opportunities
   for efficiency and scalability, they also challenge foundational
   assumptions about what counts as evidence, how it is interpreted and who
   holds epistemic authority. The article argues that models of
   evidence-informed policy and practice (EIPP), although still valuable,
   require recalibration to address the emerging demands of educational
   contexts mediated by artificial intelligence. Drawing on recent research
   in artificial intelligence, critical thinking and professional practice,
   the article proposes a reframing model-EIPP-CT (Evidence-Informed Policy
   and Practice with Critical Thinking)-that places critical thinking at
   the heart of evidence use. Here, critical thinking is conceptualised not
   merely as a cognitive skill, but as a professional stance encompassing
   interpretive judgement, epistemic reflexivity and ethical
   responsibility. The article outlines key risks of over-reliance on
   content generated by artificial intelligence, including automation bias
   and diminished transparency, and advocates for institutional safeguards
   and professional development that foster context-sensitive, deliberative
   engagement with evidence. It concludes by calling for more systematic
   research and policy attention to the shifting epistemic landscape of
   education. In doing so, it aims to preserve the integrity of
   evidence-informed decision-making in a world increasingly shaped by

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},

Pages = {1787-1798},
Abstract = {Commercial utilization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is
   expanding rapidly. However, few studies have investigated the
   transformative impact of GAI on business operations, with a specific
   focus on research and development (R\&D) and advertising facilitated by
   AI-generated content (AIGC) empowerment; particularly, there is a lack
   of analysis on the impact of AIGC iteration on firms' decision-making.
   The study uses the optimal control and learning-by-doing method to
   examine two types of AIGC strategies, the single AIGC (enhancing R\&D
   exclusively) and the dual AIGC (simultaneously boosting R\&D and
   advertising), to delve into their dynamic iteration effects on firms'
   performance. Our findings reveal that, under the single AIGC strategy,
   focusing on investments in the AI training R\&D sector alone can enhance
   the GAI smartness level more effectively than adopting the dual AIGC
   strategy. Conversely, under the dual AIGC strategy, firms initially tend
   to select GAI empowerment toward the downstream advertising sector more
   than the upstream R\&D sector. Both strategies demonstrate enhanced
   profits and increased demand with higher rates of AIGC self-learning.
   Notably, considering the limited budget, firms prioritize allocating AI
   training resources to the R\&D sector under the dual AIGC strategy,
   guaranteeing their long-term success.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the collaborative supervision strategies of
   Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in the hospitality and tourism
   industry, focusing on managing risks in GAI-based travel
   recommendations. Using evolutionary game theory and system dynamics, a
   tripartite model is developed, involving the government, GAI companies,
   and tourists. Five evolutionarily stable strategies (E1, E5, E6, E7, E8)
   are identified, showing how stakeholder behaviour evolves under
   different scenarios. The model operates through `dual supervision, one
   implementation', with government regulation, tourist monitoring, and GAI
   self-regulation via AI or manual reviews. Simulations indicate that
   combined government and tourist involvement enhances self-regulation,
   with subsidies being more effective than penalties. While GAI companies
   may currently favour manual reviews, the potential for AI-driven reviews
   remains substantial. This framework provides practical insights for
   sustainable GAI governance in tourism.},

Abstract = {The development of generative artificial intelligence models is at the
   heart of two important debates in terms of copyright: firstly, does the
   use of previous works as training data constitute an infringement of
   copyright? The issue is utterly sensitive as creators fear a negative
   effect of these tools on their future careers. Secondly, what regime is
   applicable to ``outputs{''}, more precisely to textual, visual, musical
   or audiovisual contents generated by artificial intelligence? Are these
   works without an author? Are they protected by an intellectual property
   right, and if so, under what conditions and for whose benefit? These
   highly topical questions find a particular echo in the writings of the
   French semiologist and philosopher Roland Barthes (1915-1980), notably
   in his famous article entitled ``The Death of the Author{''}. The
   objectives of this study are, firstly, to present the questions raised
   by generative artificial intelligence in copyright law (mainly under the
   prism of French law, but also with regard to Romanian law, European law
   and court decisions taken on the subject in different countries), and,
   secondly, to determine to what extent the arguments developed by Roland
   Barthes, leading to relativising the role of the author, could

Abstract = {Student learning agency, encompassing key abilities, essential mental

   intention, use experience, and student learning agency by integrating
   sociocultural perceptions, intentionality, and life course perspectives.
   Data were collected from 765 Chinese university students and analyzed
   using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling.
   Results showed that key abilities and essential mental characteristics
   predicted active actions, while key abilities predicted essential mental
   characteristics; behavioral intention predicted active actions and is
   predicted by key abilities; performance expectancy and social influence
   predicted behavioral intention; performance expectancy predicted
   essential mental characteristics; facilitating conditions predicted key
   abilities but negatively predicted active actions; the frequency of
   generative AI use predicted key abilities but negatively predicted
   essential mental characteristics; the number of scenarios of generative

   algorithm},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {190-208},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {This study introduces a novel 3D preform design method that leverages
   generative artificial intelligence to optimise complex forging
   geometries. The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a
   two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged
   shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (beta-VAE) serves as the
   generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural
   networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently.
   The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using
   isosurfaces derived from Laplace's equation. A multi-objective
   optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash
   volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed
   using this method and validated through forging experiments on two
   target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV)
   manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared
   with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed
   method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill
   and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced
   computational techniques with practical validation, offering a
   systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D
   preform design in forging processes.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, particularly the
   rise of deep learning, the importance of Explainable Artificial
   Intelligence has become increasingly prominent. Among its key
   techniques, counterfactual explanation plays a crucial role in
   understanding the decision-making mechanisms of opaque models. However,
   the high dimensionality and complex feature patterns of image data pose
   significant challenges for the task of generating counterfactuals for
   images. Existing literature has proposed various algorithms based on
   different assumptions, many of which rely on the existence of
   appropriate generative models. Some of these assumptions, particularly
   the assumption regarding the existence of generative models, may be
   overly stringent. To address this issue, this letter introduces a novel
   assumption-free image counterfactual generation algorithm, DFO-S, based
   on Score Matching and gradient-free optimization techniques. The
   proposed method achieves high-quality counterfactual generation without
   relying on generative models. Through extensive empirical analysis, we

Abstract = {Diffusion models are increasingly favored over traditional approaches

Abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive examination of the ongoing debate
   surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its societal implications,

   Augmented Intelligence has been introduced as a concept utilizing AI to
   enhance human capabilities but its distinction as an assistive role is
   ill-defined. This research provides insights into the
   reconceptualization of AI as Augmented Intelligence examining their
   differences in terms of knowledge development, decision-making, and
   outcomes. Through three case studies, we demonstrate the assistive role
   of Augmented Intelligence and how it can serve as a catalyst for job
   creation and cognitive enhancement. We also explore the impact of AI and
   IA tools as a sociotechnical system and their effect on human cognitive
   abilities through the theoretical lens of the Dunning Kruger Effect. We
   conclude with a research agenda to stimulate future directions of

Abstract = {This article examines sociotechnical imaginaries of generative
   artificial intelligence (GenAI) through the cultural lens of the film
   Barbie. The hyperreal setting of Barbieland serves as a prescient
   metaphor for education in an increasingly synthetic world where the real
   and artificial converge. By analysing representations of artificiality
   and authenticity in the film, I argue that similar cultural assumptions
   and anxieties shape how GenAI is understood and implemented in
   education. The Barbie doll's transformation from plastic figure to
   `real' human raises questions about embodiment and identity that
   parallel debates about human-machine relationships in learning
   environments. Drawing on concepts of simulacra and agential realism, I
   explore how narratives of technological empowerment influence
   educational practice. By juxtaposing Western-centric views of Barbie
   with Indigenous perspectives, particularly Ellen van Neerven's `Water',
   the article critiques dominant cultural narratives about technology and
   intelligence. This comparison challenges commercial imaginaries of
   technological empowerment and suggests more diverse, culturally
   responsive approaches are needed to integrate GenAI in education.},

Abstract = {The utilisation of Chat Generative Pre -Trained Transformer (ChatGPT)
   and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies has started
   to demonstrate its impact across several domains. The swift shift and
   widespread implementation of efficient artificial intelligence (AI)
   present distinct prospects such as optimisation, advancement, enhanced
   efficiency, boosted sales and marketing, expansion, reduced costs, and
   heightened profitability. GenAI has the potential to create a
   competition crisis between technologically advanced enterprises and less
   developed ones. Additionally, it may give rise to legal, moral, and
   ethical issues such as copyright infringement and the production of fake
   and false information. Hence, it is crucial for organisations to ensure
   that the productivity of AI is maximized in order to maximise its
   benefits and minimise any potential harm. The aim of this study is to
   provide suggestions regarding the use and potential of GenAI
   technologies in the corporate sector and to emphasise the potential
   research areas of future GenAI. This study contributes to research and
   practice in business and management and also identifies future research
   avenues. This study examines the benefits and disadvantages of using
   GenAI tools in businesses and individual departments, and it highlights
   the potential risks and dangers. A bibliometric analysis of 198 studies
   in the discipline of Business \& Management from the Scopus database was
   conducted using the R program's bibliometrix package. The study focuses
   on descriptive data, annual scientific production, most productive
   journals, most productive authors and authors dominance factor, most
   cited publications, and most relevant keywords. The findings show that
   GenAI is likely to continue with a strong and rapidly rising trend in
   2024 and beyond.},

   the realm of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), which is poised
   as the next digital frontier. However, the dominance of English in

   commendable performance of GAI in select developed languages like
   French, Spanish, and Japanese, it struggles to deliver comparable
   results in low-resource languages (LRLs) such as Bengali, Hindi, and
   Swahili. These languages, deprived of adequate online content, face
   obstacles in training specialized models due to script complexities and
   limited lexical resources. While countries like Japan and Iceland offer
   promising models for addressing linguistic challenges, the road ahead
   necessitates collaborative efforts to develop LLMs tailored for LRLs and

Abstract = {The rapid advancements in generative artificial intelligence are set to
   significantly influence the medical sector, particularly ophthalmology.
   Generative adversarial networks and diffusion models enable the creation
   of synthetic images, aiding the development of deep learning models
   tailored for specific imaging tasks. Additionally, the advent of
   multimodal foundational models, capable of generating images, text and
   videos, presents a broad spectrum of applications within ophthalmology.
   These range from enhancing diagnostic accuracy to improving patient
   education and training healthcare professionals. Despite the promising
   potential, this area of technology is still in its infancy, and there
   are several challenges to be addressed, including data bias, safety
   concerns and the practical implementation of these technologies in
   clinical settings.},

Title = {Unleashing the Potential of Generative AI, Conversational Agents and
   Chatbots in Educational Praxis: A Systematic Review and Bibliometric
   Analysis of GenAI in Education},
Journal = {OPEN PRAXIS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {261-270},
Abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the pivotal axis around
   which transformation revolves is human-AI interaction. In this sense,
   this paper adopts a data mining and analytic approach to understand what
   the related literature tells us regarding the trends and patterns of
   generative AI research in educational praxis. Accordingly, this
   systematic exploration spotlights the following research themes:
   Interaction and communication with generative AI-powered chatbots;
   impact of the LLMs and generative AI on teaching and learning,
   conversational educational agents and their opportunities, challenges,
   and implications; leveraging Generative AI for enhancing social and
   cognitive learning processes; promoting AI literacy for unleashing
   future opportunities; harnessing Generative AI to expand academic
   capabilities, and lastly, augmenting educational experiences through
   human-AI interaction. Beyond the identified research themes and
   patterns, this paper argues that emotional intelligence, AI literacy,
   and prompt engineering are the trending research topics that require
   further exploration. Accordingly, it's in this praxis that emotional
   intelligence emerges as a pivotal attribute, as AI technologies often
   struggle to comprehend and respond to the nuanced emotional cues.
   Generative AI literacy then takes center stage, becoming an
   indispensable asset in an era permeated with AI technologies, equipping
   students with the tools to critically engage with AI systems, thereby
   ensuring they become active, discerning users of these powerful tools.
   Concurrently, prompt engineering, the art of crafting queries that yield
   precise and valuable responses from AI systems, empowers both educators
   and students to maximize the utility of AI-driven educational resources.},

   `wrongness at scale' or job market implications. It also ponders
   implications for research on science communication, which has largely
   neglected (generative) AI so far. It argues that scholars should analyze
   public communication about AI as well as communication with AI, given
   its `increased agency'. Furthermore, scholars should analyze the impact

Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},

Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence (AI) approach
   to generate images of strain-hardening cementitious composite (SHCC)
   with complex crack patterns such as dense microcracks. This approach is
   developed to address the challenge of lacking data for training deep
   learning models used to automatically measure cracks in SHCC. The
   development of the approach is based on a framework which results in a
   hybrid generative adversarial network (HGAN) that seamlessly integrates
   a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) for
   generating images and a conditional generative adversarial network
   (CGAN) for labelling images. From the results, it was found that this
   approach provided high-quality labelled images automatically, and using
   these images significantly improved the accuracy of the deep learning
   models for measuring cracks in SHCC. The F1 score and Intersection Over
   Union (IOU) for crack segmentation reached 0.982 and 0.980,
   respectively. This approach will significantly promote crack measurement
   for SHCC materials and structures.},

   A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {87742-87766},
Abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs), which generate personalized content, have
   become a technological tool with diverse applications for users. While
   numerous RSs have been proposed and successfully implemented across
   various domains, traditional AI-based RSs still encounter certain
   challenges, such as data sparsity, cold start, and diversity. Generative
   Artificial Intelligence in recommender systems is a recent advancement
   used by platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon to recommend items,
   news, videos, audios, goods, and services to their customers/users or to
   personalize experiences for their customers/users. The main purpose of
   this review is to compare traditional AI-based recommender systems with
   generative AI-based recommender systems. A total of fifty-two (52)
   papers, published between 2019 and February 2024, were selected from six
   major online libraries. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the
   selected study, we reviewed the selected studies techniques, and the
   models, datasets, and metrics used. Our systematic review reveals that
   generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),
   variational autoencoder (VAEs) and autoencoders have been widely used in
   recommender systems and they perform better than traditional AI
   techniques. Among the 30 datasets analyzed, MovieLens was the most
   frequently used, accounting for 33\%, while Amazon datasets accounted
   for 11\%, Recall and RSME are the most commonly used metrics. Our
   literature review offers understandings into the Generative AI
   techniques used across different recommender systems and provides
   suggestions for the future research. Finally, we elaborated on open
   issues and discussed current and future trends in generative AI-based

   nursing.ObjectiveA review of studies related to the application of
   generative artificial intelligence in the field of specialized
   cardiovascular nursing informing relevant research and
   practice.MethodsThis review was conducted according to the JBI
   guidelines for scoping reviews, using the PRISMA-ScR reporting tool.The
   databases searched included PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, APA
   PsycNetInfo (Ovid), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL,
   SinoMed, CNKI, WanFang databases, peer-reviewed studies written in
   English and Chinese from the time of database construction until March
   29, 2025. Eligible studies were screened by title and abstract, and
   full-text screening was performed by two independent
   evaluators.ResultsNineteen studies were included in this review, and the
   main application tools were 9 text generation models, 3 multimodal
   generation models, 4 temporal prediction models, and 3 chatbots. The
   application scenarios mainly include clinical decision support, patient
   health management, and nursing education and counseling. Generative
   artificial intelligence has outstanding effects in reducing nursing
   workload and precise intervention, but there are limitations in the
   field of health education and counseling, such as logical disconnection,
   poor information quality, and lack of humanistic
   care.ConclusionsGenerative artificial intelligence provides technical
   support for the intelligent transformation of cardiovascular specialty
   care, especially effective in the areas of clinical decision support and
   patient health management. There is an urgent need to solve the existing
   problems to promote its in-depth application in this field, and it is
   suggested that future research focuses on the construction of

   attitude scale for students},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Introduction Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as
   ChatGPT, have gained significant traction in educational settings,
   offering novel opportunities for enhanced learning experiences. However,
   limited research has investigated how students perceive and accept these
   emerging technologies. This study addresses this gap by developing a
   scale to assess university students' attitudes toward generative AI
   tools in education.Methods A three-stage process was employed to develop
   and validate the Generative AI Attitude Scale. Data were collected from
   664 students from various faculties during the 2022-2023 academic year.
   Expert evaluations were conducted to establish face and content
   validity. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on a subset
   of 400 participants, revealing a two-factor, 14-item structure that
   explained 78.440\% of the variance. A subsequent confirmatory factor
   analysis (CFA) was conducted on a separate sample of 264 students to
   validate this structure, resulting in the removal of one item and a
   final 13-item scale.Results The 13-item scale demonstrated strong
   reliability, evidenced by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 and a test-retest
   reliability of 0.90. Discriminative power was confirmed through
   corrected item-total correlations between lower and upper percentile
   groups. These findings indicate that the scale effectively
   differentiates student attitudes toward generative AI tools in
   educational contexts.Discussion The newly developed Generative AI
   Attitude Scale offers a valid and reliable instrument for measuring
   university students' perspectives on integrating generative AI tools,
   such as ChatGPT, into educational environments. These results highlight
   the potential for more targeted research and informed implementation
   strategies to enhance learning outcomes through generative AI.},

   emergence of recent tools, such as ChatGPT, appear to have left the
   educational community unprepared, despite the fact that the computer
   science community has been working to develop and improve such tools for
   years. This paper provides an introduction to text generation tools
   intended for a non-specialist audience, discussing the types of
   assessments that students can outsource, showing the type of prompts
   that can be used to generate text, and illustrating one possible
   watermarking technique that may allow generated text to be detected. A
   small-scale study into watermarking suggests that this technique is
   feasible and show technical promise but should not be relied on as a
   solution to widespread use of artificial intelligence based tools by
   students. Alternative solutions are needed, including encouraging the
   educational community to work with artificial intelligence rather than
   against it. As such, the paper concludes by discussing seven potential
   areas for further exploration.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) requires substantial
   computational resources for model training and inference, but the
   electronic-waste (e-waste) implications of GAI and its management
   strategies remain underexplored. Here we introduce a computational
   power-driven material flow analysis framework to quantify and explore
   ways of managing the e-waste generated by GAI, with a particular focus
   on large language models. Our findings indicate that this e-waste stream
   could increase, potentially reaching a total accumulation of 1.2-5.0
   million tons during 2020-2030, under different future GAI development
   settings. This may be intensified in the context of geopolitical
   restrictions on semiconductor imports and the rapid server turnover for
   operational cost savings. Meanwhile, we show that the implementation of
   circular economy strategies along the GAI value chain could reduce
   e-waste generation by 16-86\%. This underscores the importance of
   proactive e-waste management in the face of advancing GAI technologies.
   Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is driving a surge in e-waste
   due to intensive computational infrastructure needs. This study
   emphasizes the necessity for proactive implementation of circular

Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is heralding a new era in AI for
   performing a spectrum of complex tasks that are indistinguishable from

Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {88},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Aims: This study aimed to explore the effects of interactive teaching
   strategies based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) under the
   guidance of outcome-based education (OBE) theory on higher-order
   thinking skills (HOTS) and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy of
   undergraduate nursing students. Background: Recently, GenAI-assisted
   teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education
   reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the
   era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to
   enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are
   limited. Design: A quasi-experimental study. Methods: Based on OBE
   theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into
   a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates
   enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66)
   and control groups (n = 66). Results: After completing the course, the
   HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P <
   0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in
   the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores
   (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group
   before and after the course. Conclusion: GenAI-assisted teaching could
   help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy. As an
   important auxiliary teaching tool, GenAI should be integrated into other
   nursing courses and widely applied in nursing education in the future.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To provide an introduction to the uses of generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) and foundation models, including large
   language models, in the field of health technology assessment (HTA).
   Methods: We reviewed applications of generative AI in 3 areas:
   systematic literature reviews, real- world evidence, and health economic
   modeling. Results: (1) Literature reviews: generative AI has the
   potential to assist in automating aspects of systematic literature
   reviews by proposing search terms, screening abstracts, extracting data,
   and generating code for meta-analyses; (2) real-world evidence:
   generative AI can facilitate automating processes and analyze large
   collections of real-world data, including unstructured clinical notes
   and imaging; (3) health economic modeling: generative AI can aid in the
   development of health economic models, from conceptualization to
   validation. Limitations in the use of foundation models and large
   language models include challenges surrounding their scientific rigor
   and reliability, the potential for bias, implications for equity, as
   well as nontrivial concerns regarding adherence to regulatory and
   ethical standards, particularly in terms of data privacy and security.
   Additionally, we survey the current policy landscape and provide
   suggestions for HTA agencies on responsibly integrating generative AI
   into their workflows, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and
   the fast-evolving nature of these tools. Conclusions: Although
   generative AI technology holds promise with respect to HTA applications,
   it is still undergoing rapid developments and improvements. Continued
   careful evaluation of their applications to HTA is required. Both
   developers and users of research incorporating these tools, should
   familiarize themselves with their current capabilities and limitations.},

Abstract = {With the commercialization of ChatGPT, , generative artificial

   However, even though generative AI has become a daily technology that
   anyone can use, most non-majors need to know the process and reason for
   the results because it can be misused due to lack of sufficient
   knowledge and misunderstanding. Therefore, this study investigated
   users' preferences for when, what, and how generative AI should provide
   explanations about the process of generating and the reasoning behind
   the results, using conjoint method and mixed logit analysis. The results
   show that users are most sensitive to the timing of providing
   eXplainable AI (XAI), and that users want additional information only
   when they ask for explanations during the process of using generative
   AI. The results of this study will help shape the XAI design of future
   generative AI from a user perspective and improve usability.},

   field that has positively impacted the drug discovery process. Deep
   reinforcement learning is a subdivision of machine learning that
   combines artificial neural networks with reinforcement-learning
   architectures. This method has successfully been em-ployed to develop
   novel de novo drug design approaches using a variety of artificial
   networks including recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural
   networks, generative adversarial networks, and autoencoders. This review

Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has developed as an effective
   tool for time series predicting, revolutionizing the typical methods of
   prediction. Different classical approaches that depend on existing
   approaches and assumptions, generative AI controls advanced deep
   learning (DL) approaches like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
   recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to identify designs and connections in
   time series data. DL has accomplished major success in optimizing
   performances connected with AI. In the financial area, it can be
   extremely utilized for the stock market predictive, trade implementation
   approaches, and set of optimizers. Stock market predictive is the most
   important use case in this field. GANs with advanced AI approaches have
   become more significant in recent times. However, it can be utilized in
   image-image-translation and other computer vision (CV) conditions. GANs
   could not utilized greatly for stock market prediction because of their
   effort to establish the proper set of hyperparameters. This study
   develops an integrated spotted hyena optimization algorithm with
   generative artificial intelligence for time series forecasting
   (SHOAGAI-TSF) technique. The purpose of the SHOAGAI-TSF technique is to
   accomplish a forecasting process for the utilization of stock price
   prediction. The SHOAGAI-TSF technique uses probabilistic forecasting
   with a conditional GAN (CGAN) approach for the prediction of stock
   prices. The CGAN model learns the data generation distribution and
   determines the probabilistic prediction from it. To boost the prediction
   results of the CGAN approach, the hyperparameter tuning can be performed
   by the use of the SHOA. The simulation result analysis of the
   SHOAGAI-TSF technique takes place on the stock market dataset. The
   experimental outcomes determine the significant solution of the
   SHOAGAI-TSF algorithm with other compared methods in terms of distinct
   metrics.},

Abstract = {Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have emerged as potent tools for
   generating high-quality, creative content across various media,
   including audio, images, videos, and 3-D models. Their application in
   artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) marks a pivotal
   advancement in the evolution from the Internet of Things (IoT) to the
   Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Considering the inherent
   multiple-access nature of AIoT, training GDMs via federated learning and
   deploying them collaboratively is paramount. However, such approaches
   introduce considerable security risks and energy consumption challenges.
   To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive architecture for
   GDMs, encompassing both training and sampling stages. This architecture,
   termed secure and sustainable diffusion (SS-Diff), aims to thwart
   trigger-based security threats, such as backdoor attacks and trojan
   attacks, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption in
   multiple-access AIoT. The SS-Diff architecture incorporates a dynamic
   quantization mechanism within the training phase, significantly reducing
   communication overhead and thereby improving both spectrum and energy
   efficiency. During the sampling stage, a detection-based defense
   strategy is employed to identify and negate trigger inputs associated
   with malicious attacks. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the
   performance of the SS-Diff architecture. The results demonstrate that
   the SS-Diff can effectively train GDMs and eliminate the impact of the
   attacks, compared with existing schemes.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article draws on the Foucauldian concept of ``discursive
   formation{''} to conceptualize generative artificial intelligence
   (GAI)'s potential influence on management. It shows how ChatGPT, a
   typical GAI, can affect practices, decision-making responsibility and
   the management disciplines through a dual discourse. The first one
   emanates from technological solutionism, a belief that any problem can
   be solved with the assistance of technology (the technosolutionist
   discourse), and the second one concerns the utterances generated by
   ChatGPT itself, which are shaped by various algorithmic, epistemic and
   linguistic influences (the generative discourse). In simpler terms, what
   ChatGPT can do to management appears to depend on ``what is said about
   it{''} and ``what it says{''}. In contrast to the existing literature on
   ChatGPT's potential influence on organizations, this article, through
   its discursive approach, takes a non-normative position, to reveal the
   subtler influences of generative artificial intelligence, and highlight
   the individual and organizational responsibilities of actors interacting
   with these two discourses. The conclusions may be of interest to
   management readers in general, and of more particular interest to the
   accounting profession, as the conceptualization is based more broadly on

   trends in Generative AI-driven drug discovery, such as protein-protein
   interactions (PPIs), drug-target interactions (DTIs) and de-novo drug
   design. However, these approaches face significant challenges, including
   applicability domain issues, lack of interpretability, data scarcity,
   novelty, scalability, computational resource limitations, and the
   absence of standardized evaluation metrics. These challenges hinder
   model performance, complicate decision-making, and limit the generation
   of novel and viable drug candidates. To address these issues, strategies
   such as hybrid models, integration of multiomics datasets, explainable
   AI (XAI) techniques, data augmentation, transfer learning, and
   cloud-based solutions are proposed. Additionally, a curated list of
   databases supporting drug discovery research is provided. The review
   concludes by emphasizing the need for optimized AI models, robust
   validation methods, interdisciplinary collaboration, and future academic
   efforts to fully realize the potential of Generative AI in advancing
   drug discovery.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I take the cultural effects of generative artificial
   intelligence (generative AI) as a context for examining a broader
   perspective of AI's impact on contemporary art notions. After the
   introductory overview of generative AI, I summarize the distinct but
   often confused aspects of art notions and review the principal lines in
   which AI influences them: the strategic normalization of AI through art,
   the representation of AI art in the artworld, academia, and AI research,
   and the mutual permeability of art and kitsch in the digital culture. I
   connect these notional factors with the conceptual and ideological
   substrate of the computer science and AI industry, which blends the
   machinic agency fetishism, the equalization of computers and humans, the
   sociotechnical blindness, and cyberlibertarianism. The overtones of
   alienation, sociopathy, and misanthropy in the disparate but somehow
   coalescing philosophical premises, technical ideas, and political views
   in this substrate remain underexposed in AI studies so, in the closing
   discussion, I outline their manifestations in generative AI and
   introduce several viewpoints for a further critique of AI's cultural
   zeitgeist. They add a touch of skepticism to pondering how technological
   trends change our understanding of art and in which directions they stir
   its social, economic, and political roles.},

Abstract = {The emergence and popularity of generative artificial intelligence (AI)
   tools, particularly text-based ones known as large language models, pose
   both opportunities and challenges to education. The ability of these
   tools to generate human-like texts based on minimal instructions causes
   concerns among educators about students' use of these tools for academic
   writing, which may constitute a breach of academic integrity. We propose
   a pedagogical design that models on selfregulated learning and the
   authoring cycle and develops students' critical thinking and
   self-regulation when composing academic writing using text-based
   generative AI tools. It contains six iterative and interactive phases.
   Students first plan the content and structure of the writing, then
   generate prompts for text-based generative AI tools. Next, students
   preview and verify the tools' output, followed by the fourth phase of
   producing the writing using the corrected output. Fifthly, peer review
   by fellow students may be required to polish and proofread the writing.
   Lastly, through portfolio-tracking, students reflect on the writing
   process, and formulate strategies for future usage of text-based
   generative AI tools for writing. This pedagogical design helps students
   and teachers embrace text-based generative AI while addressing the
   perils these tools present, and guides the development of education
   interventions and instruments.},

Abstract = {Objectives The objective of this study was to explore the feature of
   generative artificial intelligence (AI) in asking sexual health among
   cancer survivors, which are often challenging for patients to discuss.
   Methods We employed the Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3.5 (GPT) as
   the generative AI platform and used DocsBot for citation retrieval (June
   2023). A structured prompt was devised to generate 100 questions from
   the AI, based on epidemiological survey data regarding sexual
   difficulties among cancer survivors. These questions were submitted to
   Bot1 (standard GPT) and Bot2 (sourced from two clinical guidelines).
   Results No censorship of sexual expressions or medical terms occurred.
   Despite the lack of reflection on guideline recommendations,
   `consultation' was significantly more prevalent in both bots' responses
   compared with pharmacological interventions, with ORs of 47.3 (p<0.001)
   in Bot1 and 97.2 (p<0.001) in Bot2. Discussion Generative AI can serve
   to provide health information on sensitive topics such as sexual health,
   despite the potential for policy-restricted content. Responses were
   biased towards non-pharmacological interventions, which is probably due
   to a GPT model designed with the `s prohibition policy on replying to
   medical topics. This shift warrants attention as it could potentially
   trigger patients' expectations for non-pharmacological interventions.},

   convey to students the importance of transparency, and how to display it
   when using GenAI tools to write assignments. In this paper, a
   theoretical model of academic assignment writing is presented,
   explaining at which phases of the writing process GenAI can be used with
   integrity and which phases must absolutely be done by the student. The
   appropriate use of GenAI tools when deploying informational, writing and
   referencing competencies to write an assignment is discussed. Advice on
   modifying existing institutional academic integrity policies, giving
   clear guidelines and permissions are presented as well as various
   methods of declaring GenAI usage.},

Abstract = {The growth of intelligent vehicular services, like augmented reality
   (AR) road simulation, underscores the need for rapid, multi-modal
   content generation. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models,
   known for their swift production of diverse artificial
   intelligence-generated content (AIGC), stand out as a prime solution.
   However, integrating cloud-centric GAI models into vehicular networks is
   fraught with challenges. Notably, to offer specialized generative edge
   intelligence (EI) and boost vehicular AIGC, GAI models need to tap into
   user data and utilize significant computation resources. Moreover, their
   deployment across vehicular networks is essential for proximity-based
   distributed inferences. Yet, edge devices are resource-limited, and data
   sharing can raise safety and privacy concerns. Addressing these
   challenges, this paper introduces GAI-IoV, an EI-enabled GAI framework
   facilitated through the cooperation between road-side units (RSUs) and
   vehicles. Subsequently, we propose the workflow for collaborative
   fine-tuning and distributed inference. On this basis, two pivotal
   vehicle-centric problems are then formulated: computation and
   communication resource allocation for federated fine-tuning (FFT) to
   optimize time and energy cost, and splitting strategy of shared and
   local inferences to optimize inference latency and content-generation
   capability. To solve these optimizations, we introduce a self-adaptive
   global best harmony search (SGHS) algorithm for resource allocation and
   a backward induction method for determining inference splitting
   strategy. Our experiments based on the Stable Diffusion v1-4 model vouch
   for a superior fine-tuning and inference capabilities of GAI-IoV.
   Furthermore, simulations underscore its resource utilization and
   distributed inference efficiency in dynamic vehicular scenarios.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {239},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study proposes a game design framework using generative artificial
   intelligence based non-player character for providing simulated
   interactions and instant feedback as a metacognitive scaffolding to help
   learners develop workplace communication skills and stress resistance
   through situational experience learning. This study investigates
   learning effectiveness and psychological responses, including flow,
   perceived fidelity, cognitive load, and qualitative feedback, and
   specifically analyzes the behavioral patterns of learners interacting
   with generative artificial intelligence. A total of 91 participants were
   enrolled in this study and divided into three groups: experimental group
   1 (generative artificial intelligence interactive metacognitive
   scaffolding), experimental group 2 (video metacognitive scaffolding),
   and control group (text metacognitive scaffolding). The results showed
   that students in the generative artificial intelligence group responded
   with higher perceived fidelity and were significantly better than the
   control group with text-based metacognitive scaffolding in terms of
   learning effectiveness, flow, and germane cognitive load. Behavioral
   pattern analysis reveals that learners can effectively obtain a lot of
   positive help in solving tasks through positive interactions with
   non-player character chatbot. This framework and the findings of the
   study can be used as a reference for related studies in the field of
   game-based learning in the use of metacognitive scaffolding, contextual
   learning, and generative AI. Due to the short experimental period, the
   results may only reflect the short-term learning effects, and the
   novelty of Gen AI may also cause bias in affecting the learning
   outcomes, future studies can increase the duration or number of
   experiences, and explore the effectiveness in other professional
   domains.},

   programming learning resource},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 AUG 15},
Abstract = {Generative AI has the potential to serve as a valuable learning resource
   in programming education by offering individualized learning
   experiences, self-directed learning support, and automatic feedback.
   However, research on the factors influencing its adoption in programming
   education in students' perspectives is scarce. Thus, this study
   investigates the factors that motivate students to utilize generative AI
   as a programming learning tool. The focus is on how technophilia and
   perceived intelligence affect how students think about and use
   technology. We conducted a survey involving 410 respondents and analyzed
   the data using SmartPLS and structural equation modeling (SEM). The
   findings show that both technophilia and perceived intelligence have a
   significant impact on perceived usefulness, ease of use, trust, and
   enjoyment, all of which have an indirect effect on adoption intention.
   Furthermore, perceived usefulness, enjoyment, and trust significantly
   impact students' intention to use generative AI in programming learning,
   while perceived ease of use lacks this impact. These findings offer
   significant insights for generative AI developers and policymakers
   seeking to improve the intelligence and usability of generative AI in
   programming education. This study advances AI-driven programming
   education by providing a deeper understanding of students' adoption
   behaviors, resulting in more effective and engaging learning

Volume = {75},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study is to present the possibilities of nurse
   education in the use of the Chat Generative Pretraining Transformer
   (ChatGPT) tool to support the documentation process. Background: The
   success of the nursing process is based on the accuracy of nursing
   diagnoses, which also determine nursing interventions and nursing
   outcomes. Educating nurses in the use of artificial intelligence in the
   nursing process can significantly reduce the time nurses spend on
   documentation. Design: Discussion paper. Methods: We used a case study
   from Train4Health in the field of preventive care to demonstrate the
   potential of using Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) to
   educate nurses in documenting the nursing process using generative
   artificial intelligence. Based on the case study, we entered a
   description of the patient's condition into Generative Pre -training
   Transformer (ChatGPT) and asked questions about nursing diagnoses,
   nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. We further synthesized these
   results. Results: In the process of educating nurses about the nursing
   process and nursing diagnosis, Generative Pretraining Transformer
   (ChatGPT) can present potential patient problems to nurses and guide
   them through the process from taking a medical history, setting nursing
   diagnoses and planning goals and interventions. Generative Pre -training
   Transformer (ChatGPT) returned appropriate nursing diagnoses, but these
   were not in line with the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association -
   International (NANDA-I) classification as requested. Of all the nursing
   diagnoses provided, only one was consistent with the most recent version
   of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International
   (NANDA-I). Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) is still not
   specific enough for nursing diagnoses, resulting in incorrect answers in
   several cases. Conclusions: Using Generative Pre -training Transformer
   (ChatGPT) to educate nurses and support the documentation process is
   time -efficient, but it still requires a certain level of human critical

Abstract = {This article argues that significant risks are being taken with using

   this paper is divided into three parts. First, it examines the needs of
   patients in mental health. Second, it explores the potential benefits of
   GenAI in mental health and highlights the risks of its use as it
   pertains to patient needs. Third, it notes the ethical and legal
   concerns around data use and medical liability that require careful

Year = {2025},
Volume = {107},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging
   technology in healthcare education with potential to enhance simulation
   by addressing logistical barriers and by providing increased access to
   diverse settings in healthcare education, leading to improved learning
   outcomes. This rapid scoping review explores the use of generative AI in
   simulation-based education. Methods: Searches were conducted in CINAHL,
   Medline, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science using terms such as
   ``generative artificial intelligence{''} and ``healthcare
   simulation.{''} The review followed the World Health Organization (WHO)
   Rapid Review Guide and was structured using Arksey and O'Malley's
   five-stage framework for scoping reviews. Results: After applying
   inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles were included. Five themes
   emerged: (1) removal of logistical barriers, (2) authentic practice, (3)
   distinctive value, (4) limitations of generative AI, and (5) potential
   with human oversight. Generative AI improves access to simulation by
   creating cost-effective, scalable, and realistic scenarios while
   fostering critical thinking through reflective learning. However,
   challenges such as misinformation and ethical concerns remain.
   Conclusions: This scoping review identified growing momentum around
   generative AI's role in healthcare simulation. While early studies
   highlight its potential to support scalable, adaptive, and authentic
   training experiences, effective integration requires strong governance,
   ethical safeguards, and human oversight. Published by Elsevier Inc. on

   nature and limitation of these tools. Such distortions can undermine
   trust and hinder the effective adoption and integration of AI into
   society. This study aims to address this issue by exploring the
   expectations and perceptions of young individuals regarding Generative
   Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools. It explores their understanding of
   GAI and related devices, such as virtual assistants, chatbots, and
   social robots, which can incorporate GAI. A total of N=100 university
   students engaged in this study by completing a digital questionnaire
   distributed through the virtual campus of the University of La Laguna.
   The quantitative analysis uncovered a significant gap in participants'
   understanding of GAI terminology and its underlying mechanisms.
   Additionally, it shed light on a noteworthy gender-based discrepancy in
   the expressed concerns. Participants commonly recognized their ability
   to communicate effectively with GAI, asserting that such interactions
   enhance their emotional well-being. Notably, virtual assistants and
   chatbots were perceived as more valuable tools compared to social robots
   within the educational realm.},

Title = {When AI Becomes a Shopping Advisor: A Study on the Impact of Generative
   AI Review on Consumer Purchase Decision},
Journal = {SAGE OPEN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With the swift advancement of artificial intelligence technology,
   generative AI reviews, as a novel form of online evaluation, are
   increasingly capturing consumers' attention, thereby infusing innovation
   into the traditional online review paradigm. This technology, grounded
   in big data and sophisticated machine learning algorithms, seamlessly
   integrates users' historical behavior data with real-time demand
   information. By meticulously excavating both commonalities and
   discrepancies from a vast corpus of reviews, it presents consumers with
   a more holistic and objective product representation. Nevertheless, the
   utility, transparency, and the fostering of consumer trust in generative
   AI reviews have precipitated extensive discourse. Drawing upon the
   Elaboration Likelihood Model, this investigation delves into the
   multifaceted attributes of generative AI reviews. Employing a
   questionnaire survey methodology, it systematically explores their
   influence on consumer purchase decision-making behavior. The findings
   reveal that the quality, emotional resonance, length, and credibility of
   generative AI reviews exert a positive influence on consumer purchase
   decisions. This impact is ultimately mediated through the perceived
   usefulness of the reviews. Furthermore, the inclination to trust
   artificial intelligence serves as a moderator, altering the perceived
   usefulness of reviews of varying lengths. This research not only
   enriches the landscape of online review studies and expands the horizons
   of generative AI review research but also bears substantial practical
   implications. It offers valuable insights for the refinement of the
   information ecosystem on e-commerce platforms and for enhancing consumer
   purchase decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {Aims: The aim of this study is to use generative artificial intelligence
   to perform bibliometric analysis on abstracts published at European
   Resuscitation Council (ERC) annual scientific congress and define trends
   in ERC guidelines topics over the last decade. Methods: In this
   bibliometric analysis, the WebHarvy software (SysNucleus, India) was
   used to download data from the Resuscitation journal's website through
   the technique of web scraping. Next, the Chat Generative Pre-trained
   Transformer 4 (ChatGPT-4) application programming interface (Open AI,
   USA) was used to implement the multinomial classification of abstract
   titles following the ERC 2021 guidelines topics. Results: From 2012 to
   2022 a total of 2491 abstracts have been published at ERC congresses.
   Published abstracts ranged from 88 (in 2020) to 368 (in 2015). On
   average, the most common ERC guidelines topics were Adult basic life
   support (50.1\%), followed by Adult advanced life support (41.5\%),
   while Newborn resuscitation and support of transition of infants at
   birth (2.1\%) was the least common topic. The findings also highlight
   that the Basic Life Support and Adult Advanced Life Support ERC
   guidelines topics have the strongest co-occurrence to all ERC guidelines
   topics, where the Newborn resuscitation and support of transition of
   infants at birth (2.1\%; 52/2491) ERC guidelines topic has the weakest
   co-occurrence. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the capabilities of
   generative artificial intelligence in the bibliometric analysis of

Abstract = {The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education

   Findings confirm that generative AI is being used in an ad hoc way by

Abstract = {Advocates of AI in Education (AIEd) assert that the current generation
   of technologies, collectively dubbed artificial intelligence, including
   generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), promise results that can
   transform our conceptions of what education looks like. Therefore, it is
   imperative to investigate how educators perceive GenAI and its potential
   use and future impact on education. Adopting the methodology of
   collective writing as an inquiry, this study reports on the
   participating educators' perceived grey areas (i.e. issues that are
   unclear and/or controversial) and recommendations on future research.
   The grey areas reported cover decision-making on the use of GenAI, AI
   ethics, appropriate levels of use of GenAI in education, impact on
   learning and teaching, policy, data, GenAI outputs, humans in the loop
   and public-private partnerships. Recommended directions for future
   research include learning and teaching, ethical and legal implications,
   ownership/authorship, funding, technology, research support, AI metaphor
   and types of research. Each theme or subtheme is presented in the form
   of a statement, followed by a justification. These findings serve as a
   call to action to encourage a continuing debate around GenAI and to
   engage more educators in research. The paper concludes that unless we
   can ask the right questions now, we may find that, in the pursuit of
   greater efficiency, we have lost the very essence of what it means to
   educate and learn.},

Abstract = {The integration of computer vision (CV) and generative artificial
   intelligence (GenAI) into smart agriculture has revolutionised
   traditional farming practices by enabling real-time monitoring,
   automation, and data-driven decision-making. This review systematically
   examines the applications of CV in key agricultural domains, such as
   crop health monitoring, precision farming, harvesting automation, and
   livestock management, while highlighting the transformative role of
   GenAI in addressing data scarcity and enhancing model robustness.
   Advanced techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
   YOLO variants, and transformer-based architectures, are analysed for
   their effectiveness in tasks like pest detection, fruit maturity
   classification, and field management. The survey reveals that generative
   models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
   models, significantly improve dataset diversity and model
   generalisation, particularly in low-resource scenarios. However,
   challenges persist, including environmental variability, edge deployment
   limitations, and the need for interpretable systems. Emerging trends,
   such as vision-language models and federated learning, offer promising
   avenues for future research. The study concludes that the synergy of CV
   and GenAI holds immense potential for advancing smart agriculture,
   though scalable, adaptive, and trustworthy solutions remain critical for
   widespread adoption. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable
   insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to harness AI-driven
   innovations in agricultural ecosystems.},

Title = {Generative AI and the future of education: Ragnarok or reformation? A
   paradoxical perspective from management educators},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm,
   with notable tension transpiring in the field of education. Given that
   Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this
   article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i)
   reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the
   foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in
   the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox
   theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the ``how{''}), this article (i)
   defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the
   ``ideas{''}), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the
   ``what{''}), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education
   from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the ``so what{''}).
   Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox
   \#1) Generative AI is a `friend' yet a `foe', (Paradox \#2) Generative
   AI is `capable' yet `dependent', (Paradox \#3) Generative AI is
   `accessible' yet `restrictive', and (Paradox \#4) Generative AI gets
   even `popular' when `banned' (i.e., the ``what{''}). Through a position
   that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and
   implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal
   contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should
   be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education
   reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by
   extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a
   Ragnarok that dooms the future of education of which management
   education is a part of (i.e., the ``so what{''}).},

   master. Artificial agents with greater social intelligence have
   wide-ranging applications from enabling the collaboration of human-AI
   teams to more accurately modelling human behavior in complex systems.
   Here, we show that the Naive Utility Calculus generative model is
   capable of competing with leading models in intent recognition and
   action prediction when observing stag-hunt, a simple multiplayer game
   where agents must infer each other's intentions to maximize rewards.
   Moreover, we show the model is the first with the capacity to
   out-compete human observers in intent recognition after the first round
   of observation. We conclude with a discussion on implications for the
   Naive Utility Calculus and of similar generative models in general.},

Abstract = {This review article builds upon the introductory piece in our 7-part
   series, delving deeper into the transformative potential of generative
   artificial intelligence (Gen AI) in pathology and medicine. The article
   explores the applications of Gen AI models in pathology and medicine,
   including the use of custom chatbots for diagnostic report generation,
   synthetic image synthesis for training new models, data set
   augmentation, hypothetical scenario generation for educational purposes,
   and the use of multimodal along with multiagent models. This article
   also provides an overview of the common categories within Gen AI models,
   discussing open-source and closed-source models, as well as specific
   examples of popular models such as GPT-4, Llama, Mistral, DALL-E, Stable
   Diffusion, and their associated frameworks (eg, transformers, generative
   adversarial networks, diffusion-based neural networks), along with their
   limitations and challenges, especially within the medical domain. We
   also review common libraries and tools that are currently deemed
   necessary to build and integrate such models. Finally, we look to the
   future, discussing the potential impact of Gen AI on health care,
   including benefits, challenges, and concerns related to privacy, bias,
   ethics, application programming interface costs, and security measures.

Abstract = {Natural language-based generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
   become increasingly prevalent in scientific research. Intriguingly,
   capabilities of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) language models
   beyond the scope of natural language tasks have recently been
   identified. Here we explored how GPT-4 might be able to perform
   rudimentary structural biology modeling. We prompted GPT-4 to model 3D
   structures for the 20 standard amino acids and an alpha-helical
   polypeptide chain, with the latter incorporating Wolfram mathematical
   computation. We also used GPT-4 to perform structural interaction
   analysis between the anti-viral nirmatrelvir and its target, the
   SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Geometric parameters of the generated
   structures typically approximated close to experimental references.
   However, modeling was sporadically error-prone and molecular complexity
   was not well tolerated. Interaction analysis further revealed the
   ability of GPT-4 to identify specific amino acid residues involved in
   ligand binding along with corresponding bond distances. Despite current
   limitations, we show the current capacity of natural language generative
   AI to perform basic structural biology modeling and interaction analysis
   with atomic-scale accuracy.},

Abstract = {This study applies Activity Theory to investigate how English as a
   foreign language (EFL) students prompt generative artificial
   intelligence (AI) tools during short story writing. Sixty-seven Hong
   Kong secondary school students created their own generative-AI tools
   using open-source language models and wrote short stories with them. The
   study collected and analyzed the students' generative-AI tools, short
   stories, and written reflections on their conditions or purposes for
   prompting. The research identified three main themes regarding the
   purposes for which students' prompt generative-AI tools during short
   story writing: a lack of awareness of purposes, overcoming writer's
   block, and developing, expanding, and improving the story. The study
   also identified common characteristics of students' activity systems,
   including the sophistication of their generative-AI tools, the quality
   of their stories, and their school's overall academic achievement level,
   for their prompting of generative-AI tools for the three purposes during
   short story writing. The study's findings suggest that teachers should
   be aware of students' purposes for prompting generative-AI tools to
   provide tailored instructions and scaffolded guidance. The findings may

   research?},
Journal = {SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PAIN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Background- Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models offer
   potential assistance in pain research data acquisition, yet concerns
   persist regarding data accuracy and reliability. In a comparative study,
   we evaluated open generative AI models' capacity to acquire data on
   acute pain in rock climbers comparable to field research. Methods-
   Fifty-two rock climbers (33 m/19 f; age 29.0 {[}24.0-35.75] years) were
   asked to report pain location and intensity during a single climbing
   session. Five generative pretrained transformer models were tasked with
   responses to the same questions. Results- Climbers identified the back
   of the forearm (19.2\%) and toes (17.3\%) as primary pain sites, with
   reported median pain intensity at 4 {[}3-5] and median maximum pain
   intensity at 7 {[}5-8]. Conversely, AI models yielded divergent
   findings, indicating fingers, hands, shoulders, legs, and feet as
   primary pain localizations with average and maximum pain intensity
   ranging from 3 to 4.4 and 5 to 10, respectively. Only two AI models
   provided references that were untraceable in PubMed and Google searches.
   Conclusion- Our findings reveal that, currently, open generative AI
   models cannot match the quality of field-collected data on acute pain in
   rock climbers. Moreover, the models generated nonexistent references,
   raising concerns about their reliability.},

Abstract = {With their diverse biological activities, peptides are promising
   candidates for therapeutic applications, showing antimicrobial,
   antitumour and hormonal signalling capabilities. Despite their
   advantages, therapeutic peptides face challenges such as short
   half-life, limited oral bioavailability and susceptibility to plasma
   degradation. The rise of computational tools and artificial intelligence
   (AI) in peptide research has spurred the development of advanced
   methodologies and databases that are pivotal in the exploration of these
   complex macromolecules. This perspective delves into integrating AI in
   peptide development, encompassing classifier methods, predictive systems
   and the avant-garde design facilitated by deep-generative models like
   generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders. There are
   still challenges, such as the need for processing optimization and
   careful validation of predictive models. This work outlines traditional
   strategies for machine learning model construction and training
   techniques and proposes a comprehensive AI-assisted peptide design and
   validation pipeline. The evolving landscape of peptide design using AI
   is emphasized, showcasing the practicality of these methods in

Journal = {COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 4},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to investigate the benefits and challenges of
   integrating generative artificial intelligence, particularly ChatGPT,
   into organizational learning and development (L\&D). The research seeks
   to understand how generative AI can transform learning processes,
   enhance employee development and address potential obstacles in
   implementation. Design/methodology/approach The research uses
   semi-structured interviews with 12 L\&D industry experts to gather
   insights. Braun and Clarke's (2006) thematic analysis method was used to
   analyze the collected data. Additionally, a rigorous coding process was
   undertaken using Saldana's (2009) coding methods. Initial codes were
   generated to pinpoint significant elements within the interviews that
   could reveal insights into the influence, implications and challenges of
   integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into organizational
   L\&D. Findings The study reveals that the influence and implications of
   integrating ChatGPT include attaining more efficient and effective L\&D
   programs, boosting employee performance and enhancing their engagement
   and satisfaction. However, overreliance on ChatGPT can negatively
   influence organizational knowledge sharing and team dynamics. This study
   also found that to successfully integrate ChatGPT, organizations should
   address human-related challenges (i.e. upskilling employees with
   artificial intelligence skills) and technology-related challenges (i.e.
   data privacy violations, misinformation and ChatGPT misuse by
   employees). Originality/value This research contributes to the existing
   literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted
   impact of generative AI on organizational L\&D. It provides managers
   with advice on how to manage the integration of ChatGPT in a way that
   minimizes potential negative effects while maximizing opportunities.
   This study is also significant as it provides foundational insights into
   the capabilities of ChatGPT in organizational L\&D, stressing both its
   transformative potential and the need for careful management to prevent
   misuse.},

Abstract = {Aiming at achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the
   metaverse, pretrained foundation models (PFMs), e.g., generative
   pretrained transformers (GPTs), can effectively provide various
   artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as autonomous driving,
   digital twins (DTs), and AI-generated content (AIGC) for extended
   reality (XR). With the advantages of low latency and privacy-preserving,
   serving PFMs of mobile AI services in edge intelligence is a viable
   solution for caching and executing PFMs on edge servers with limited
   computing resources and GPU memory. However, PFMs typically consist of
   billions of parameters that are computation- and memory-intensive for
   edge servers during loading and execution. In this article, we
   investigate edge PFM serving problems for mobile AIGC services of the
   metaverse. First, we introduce the fundamentals of PFMs and discuss
   their characteristic fine-tuning and inference methods in edge
   intelligence. Then, we propose a novel framework of joint model caching
   and inference for managing models and allocating resources to satisfy
   users' requests efficiently. Furthermore, considering the in-context
   learning ability of PFMs, we propose a new metric to evaluate the
   freshness and relevance between examples in demonstrations and executing
   tasks, namely the Age of Context (AoC). Finally, we propose a
   least-context (LC) algorithm for managing cached models at edge servers
   by balancing the tradeoff among latency, energy consumption, and
   accuracy.},

Month = {2025 MAR 18},
Abstract = {The emerging generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) model,
   Stable Diffusion, is increasingly recognized as a promising tool for
   efficiently translating public preferences and ideas into spatial design
   representations. At the same time, deep learning techniques and

   that leverages the Stable Diffusion model, combined with extensive
   public walking preference data, to create a workflow for generating
   revitalized street scenes aimed at enhancing subjective walking
   preferences. Compared to existing GAN-based methods, the approach used
   in this study is more efficient to train and generates more realistic
   and controllable outputs. The approach was tested and validated using
   data from Tokyo's Setagaya ward, confirming its effectiveness. This
   workflow represents a significant advancement in street design and
   redevelopment, delivering practical value and innovation by equipping
   designers and planners with rapid visual insights in the early design
   stages. Additionally, it fosters democratic urban design by utilizing

Title = {Use and Evaluation of Generative Artificial Intelligence by Medical
   Students in Japan},
Journal = {JMA JOURNAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {730-735},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Introduction: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has become more
   accessible due to technological advancements. While it can support more
   efficient learning, improper use may lead to legal issues or hinder
   self-directed learning. Medical education is no exception, as generative
   AI has the potential to become a powerful tool. However, its
   practicality remains uncertain. Therefore, we investigated how
   generative AI is perceived among medical students and utilized within
   the realm of medical education. Methods: In January 2024, we conducted a
   study with 123 second-year medical students who had completed a
   physiology course and laboratory training at Gunma University, Japan.
   Students used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) 3.5
   (OpenAI) for four tasks and evaluated its responses. A survey on the use
   of generative AI was also conducted. Responses from 117 participants
   were analyzed, excluding six non-participants. Results: Among the
   students, 41.9\% had used ChatGPT. The average scores for tasks 1-4 were
   6.5, 4.6, 7.4, and 6.2 out of 10, respectively. Although 13\% had a
   negative impression, 54 students found it challenging to apply for
   medical purposes. However, 64.1\% expressed a willingness to continue
   using generative AI, provided its use extended beyond medical contexts.
   Conclusions: Nearly 60\% of students had never used generative AI
   before, which is consistent with general usage trends. Although they
   were impressed by the speed of generative AI responses, many students
   found that it lacked precision for medical studies and required
   additional verification. Limitations of generative AI, such as
   ``hallucinations,{''} were evident in medical education. It remains
   important to educate students on AI literacy and their understanding of
   the potential issues that generative AI could bring about.},

Abstract = {ChatGPT, the most accessible generative artificial intelligence (AI)
   tool, offers considerable potential for veterinary medicine, yet a
   dedicated review of its specific applications is lacking. This review
   concisely synthesizes the latest research and practical applications of

Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI)
   into library systems is transforming the global information society,
   offering new possibilities for improving information access, management,
   and dissemination. However, these advancements also raise significant
   ethical concerns, including algorithmic bias, epistemic injustice,
   intellectual property conflicts, data privacy breaches, job
   displacement, the spread of misinformation, and increasing digital
   inequality. This review critically examines these challenges through the
   lens of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Action Line
   C10, which emphasizes the ethical dimensions of the information society.
   It argues that while such concerns are global, they are particularly
   acute in the Global South, where structural barriers such as skills
   shortages, weak policy frameworks, and limited infrastructure undermine
   equitable access to AI benefits. The review calls for a more inclusive,
   transparent, and ethically responsible approach to AI adoption in
   libraries. It underscores the essential role of libraries as stewards of
   ethical information practices and advocates for collaborative strategies
   to ensure that generative AI serves as a tool for empowerment, rather
   than a driver of deepening inequality in the information society.},

   adversarial network},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATERIALS INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Discovering novel crystals is a highly effective way to develop new
   materials, though it presents significant challenges. Recently, many
   artificial intelligence (AI) generative methods have been developed to
   generate new crystals. In this work, we present a crystal generative
   framework based on Wyckoff generative adversarial network (CGWGAN) to
   efficiently discover novel crystals. The CGWGAN includes three modules:
   a generator of crystal templates, an atom-infill module, and a crystal
   screening module. The generator uses a generative adversarial network
   (GAN) to produce crystal templates embedded with asymmetry units (ASUs),
   space groups, lattice vectors, and the total number of atoms within the
   lattice cell, ensuring that the generated templates precisely match all
   requirements of crystals. These templates become crystal candidates
   after filling in atoms of different chemical elements. These candidates
   are screened by M3GNet and the passed ones are subjected to density
   functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to finally verify their
   stability. As a showcase, the CGWGAN successfully discovers seven novel
   crystals within the Ba-Ru-O system, demonstrating its effectiveness.
   This work provides a knowledge-guided Artificial Intelligence generative
   framework for accelerating crystal discovery.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence and innovation management: Charting the evolving
   landscape},
Journal = {TECHNOVATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {136},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The excitement surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) is palpable. It
   is rapidly gaining prevalence in academia, business, and personal use.
   In particular, the emergence of generative AI, exemplified by large
   language models such as ChatGPT, has been marked by substantial media
   attention, discourse, and hype. Like most, if not all, aspects of
   business, innovation processes have been impacted. However, little is
   known about the degree of impact or the benefits that might be gained.
   To cut through the hype and understand the use of AI in innovation
   processes in businesses today, a large-scale survey amongst innovation
   managers in the USA was conducted, followed by interviews. The findings
   indicate that the use of AI in innovation processes is high and
   widespread, with AI being used for more than half of the surveyed firms'
   innovation projects. Furthermore, AI is used more in the development
   stage of the innovation process than in the idea or commercialization
   stages, which counters much of the existing discourse, which focuses on
   the idea stage. We uncover interesting differences by comparing the use
   and impact of generative AI with that of more traditional AI. Among
   these is a significant difference in expected benefits in making
   employees' jobs more fulfilling - managers believe generative AI is more
   likely to confer this benefit than traditional AI. This paper offers two
   valuable contributions. First, it enriches the evolving dialogue at the
   intersection of AI and innovation management by offering much-needed
   empirical evidence about practical applications. Second, it provides
   timely managerial implications by examining relationships between the
   use of AI and innovation performance and understanding the benefits that
   AI can confer in the innovation process.},

   consumption of traditional commodities, and the production of digital
   capital, explore the nature of digital capitalism and the
   differentiation of digital capitalism in the era of artificial
   intelligence, analyze the impact of artificial intelligence on labor
   polarization, and the results show the high-skilled labor force in the
   eastern region. The ratio to the medium-skilled labor force is 0.086.

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With the growth of Artificial Intelligence technologies, there is
   interest in studying their potential impact on university academic
   writing courses. This study examined whether AI tools are replacing
   these courses by exploring how they effectively replace traditional
   academic writing instruction and this shift's potential benefits and
   drawbacks. The researcher reviewed existing literature on integrating AI
   tools into academic writing instruction. The findings provide insights
   to educators navigating the integration of Artificial Intelligence tools
   into writing curricula while maintaining instructional quality and
   academic integrity standards. By synthesizing the latest research, this
   study can inform decisions about the appropriate use of Artificial
   Intelligence in teaching essential writing skills. Increased use of
   Artificial Intelligence writing tools has sparked debate about their
   role in academic writing instruction. Universities like Stanford have
   updated policies around Artificial Intelligence tool usage and academic
   integrity. The University of California issued guidance acknowledging
   the prevalence of generative Artificial Intelligence on campuses.
   Middlebury College banned classroom use of ChatGPT over concerns it
   could impede critical thinking and writing skill development. Results
   show that while Artificial Intelligence helps with grammar and style,
   questions remain about its impact on creativity and critical thinking.
   However, Artificial Intelligence is not replacing university writing
   courses. These courses teach critical thinking, research, citation,
   argumentation, creativity, originality, and ethics, which Artificial
   Intelligence lacks. Academic writing courses offer a complete learning
   experience. Artificial Intelligence may improve academic writing but is
   unlikely to replace traditional courses soon. A balanced approach
   integrating Artificial Intelligence support while preserving core
   elements of academic writing education appears most effective for
   preparing students for diverse writing challenges.},

Volume = {12},
Pages = {31576-31588},
Abstract = {Humans possess the remarkable capacity to comprehend narratives
   presented in text and subsequently conjure associated mental images
   through their imagination. This cognitive ability enhances their grasp
   of the content and augments their overall enjoyment. Consequently, the
   development of an automated system aimed at producing visually faithful
   images based on textual descriptions, often referred to as the
   text-to-image task, stands as a profoundly meaningful endeavor. For this
   reason, a variety of text-to-image generating artificial intelligences
   (AIs) have been devised until now. Nevertheless, the generative AIs
   introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold
   the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences
   are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge
   through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental
   results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively
   preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison
   to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves
   performance by at least 30 percent in terms of the similarity of the
   generated image and by 130 percent in terms of ROUGE(recall) .},

   Collaborative Applications for Creative and Design Industries: A
   Systematic Review of Current Approaches and Trends},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {The future of work and workplace is very much in flux. A vast amount has
   been written about artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on work,
   with much of it focused on automation and its impact in terms of
   potential job losses. This review will address one area where AI is
   being added to creative and design practitioners' toolbox to enhance
   their creativity, productivity, and design horizons. A designer's
   primary purpose is to create, or generate, the most optimal artifact or
   prototype, given a set of constraints. We have seen AI encroaching into
   this space with the advent of generative networks and generative
   adversarial networks (GANs) in particular. This area has become one of
   the most active research fields in machine learning over the past number
   of years, and a number of these techniques, particularly those around
   plausible image generation, have garnered considerable media attention.
   We will look beyond automatic techniques and solutions and see how GANs
   are being incorporated into user pipelines for design practitioners. A
   systematic review of publications indexed on ScienceDirect,
   SpringerLink, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEExplore, and ACM DigitalLibrary
   was conducted from 2015 to 2020. Results are reported according to
   PRISMA statement. From 317 search results, 34 studies (including two
   snowball sampled) are reviewed, highlighting key trends in this area.
   The studies' limitations are presented, particularly a lack of user
   studies and the prevalence of toy-examples or implementations that are
   unlikely to scale. Areas for future study are also identified.},

   Learning achievement, motivation, and self-efficacy were assessed
   through validated scales and questionnaires. Results showed that the
   ChatGPT-driven system provided personalised responses and immediate
   feedback, significantly enhancing student achievement, motivation, and
   self-efficacy. These findings underscore the feasibility of integrating

   encompasses comparative analysis and a thorough questionnaire-based
   exploration, the research sheds light on the challenges and
   opportunities of integrating Stable Diffusion into architectural
   education and practice. While receptive, some concerns existed around AI
   automation risks. The paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the
   transformative potential of generative AI, particularly Stable
   Diffusion, in reshaping workflows and educational dimensions of
   architectural design. Findings advise integrating emerging AI like
   Stable Diffusion into architecture curricula to equip students for

Journal = {KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-126},
Abstract = {This paper aims to verify whether Generative Artificial Intelligence
   tools for image generation replicate biases and social stereotypes
   present in the dominant paradigm. A case study was carried out using the
   Leonardo.Ai tool, which generated images using simple combined terms,
   namely: ``Scientist, person{''}; ``Cook, person{''}; ``Doctor,
   person{''}; ``CEO, person{''}; ``Housekeeper, person{''}; and ``Nurse,
   person{''}. The images were analyzed using Rodrigues' (2007) image
   documentary analysis methodology and Gemma Penn's (2008) contributions.
   The analysis criteria included gender, age group, ethnicity, body type,
   clothes, and circumscribed elements. The images generated by the
   Leonardo.Ai tool were found to have a series of characteristics that
   perpetuate bias and social stereotypes. Given the likely impact that
   generative Artificial Intelligence will have on the production and
   sharing of information, we conclude that, in addition to the ethical
   issues related to the creation of the tool itself, there is a need to
   discuss ways of making it more inclusive and responsible for the
   representation of information.},

Abstract = {This study examines Chinese university students' adoption of generative
   artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools by integrating the Theory of
   Planned Behavior (TPB), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and AI
   literacy dimensions into a hybrid framework. Survey data from 1006
   students across various majors and regions are analyzed using partial
   least squares structural equation modeling. Notably, AI literacy (i.e.,
   students' AI ethics, evaluation, and awareness) positively affect their
   attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, although
   the influence patterns vary according to the literacy dimension.
   Perceived privacy risks reduce AI trust, which mediates adoption
   behavior. Overall, core TPB pathways are validated, with behavioral
   intentions significantly predicting students' actual use. Gender and
   regional differences moderate the key relationships. The results of this
   study suggest that enhancing students' ethical and evaluative
   competencies, building user trust, and addressing privacy concerns could
   promote generative AI integration in education.},

Month = {2025 JUL 7},
Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced a new tool to the
   educational environment that can be used in multiple ways by both
   teachers and students. This study employed a within-subjects design to
   verify whether Generative AI can enhance students' learning

   students participated in two rounds of experiments: the Teacher
   Assistance Group, where 20 students completed the test with the
   assistance of one teacher; the Generative AI Assistance Group, where 20
   students could all have a Generative AI tool to assist in completing the
   test. The results showed that there was no significant difference in
   students' learning satisfaction between the Teacher Assistance Group and
   the Generative AI Assistance Group. Furthermore, students in the Teacher
   Assistance Group demonstrated higher self-efficacy. However, students
   achieved higher learning outcomes with the assistance of Generative AI.

   behavior of two agents, the school and the students, EGA can be used to
   identify strategies that can be used to improve the effectiveness of the
   education model in the context of the AI era. A stable evolutionary
   strategy for the school and students was devised under a variety of
   scenarios. Additionally, we conducted a numerical analysis to further
   explore the impact of several key factors on the stable strategy. The
   results indicated that schools should adopt positive supervision to
   standardize the use of AI in education, and students should be more
   active in becoming involved in AI technology. Based on this study, we
   believe that the school has the ability to provide effective suggestions
   and practical guidelines to help students succeed academically and
   embrace future trends in AI education.},

Abstract = {A revolution is taking place within the field of artificial intelligence
   (AI) with the emergence of generative AI. Although we are in an early
   phase at the clinical level, there is an exponential increase in the
   number of scientific articles that use AI (discriminative and
   generative) in their methodology. According to the current situation, we
   may be in an << AI bubble>> stage; requiring filters and tools to
   evaluate its application, based on the quality and evidence provided. In
   this sense, initiatives have been developed to determine standards and
   guidelines for the use of discriminative AI (CONSORT AI, STARD AI and
   others), and more recently for generative AI (the CHART collaborative).
   As a new technology, AI requires scientific regulation to guarantee the
   efficacy and safety of its applications, while maintaining the quality

Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is boosting anticipatory forms
   of governance, through which state actors seek to predict the future and
   strategically intervene in the present. In this context, city brains
   represent an emerging type of generative AI currently employed in urban
   governance and public policy in a growing number of cities. City brains
   are large-scale AIs residing in vast digital urban platforms, which
   manage multiple urban domains including transport, safety, health, and
   environmental monitoring. They use Large Language Models (LLMs) to
   generate visions of urban futures: visions that are in turn used by
   policymakers to generate new urban policies. In this paper, we advance a
   twofold contribution. Theoretically, we develop a critical theory of
   anticipatory governance in the age of generative AI. More specifically,
   we focus on technocratic approaches to anticipatory governance, to
   explain how the act of governing extends into the future by means of
   predictive AI technology. Our approach is critical in order to expose
   the dangers that the use of AI (generative AI, in particular) in urban
   governance poses, and to identify their causes. These dangers include
   the formation of a policy process that, under the influence of
   unintelligible LLMs, risks losing transparency and thus accountability,
   and the marginalization of human stakeholders (citizens, in particular)
   as the role of AI in the management of cities keeps growing and
   governance begins to turn posthuman. Empirically, we critically examine
   an existing city brain project under development in China and ground our
   critical theory in a real-life example.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI),
   particularly large language models (LLMs), are profoundly impacting many
   fields. In chemical engineering, GenAI plays a pivotal role in the
   design, scale-up, and optimization of chemical and biochemical

   enable the interpretation of complex chemical and biological data. Given
   the rapid developments of GenAI, this paper explores the extensive
   applications of GenAI in multiscale chemical engineering, spanning from
   quantum mechanics to macro-level optimization. At quantum and molecular
   levels, GenAI accelerates the discovery of novel products and enhances
   the understanding of fundamental phenomena. At larger scales, GenAI
   improves process design and operational efficiency, contributing to
   sustainable practices. We present several examples to demonstrate the
   role of GenAI, including its impact on nanomaterial hardness
   enhancement, novel catalyst generation, protein design, and the
   development of autonomous experimental platforms. This multiscale
   integration demonstrates the potential of GenAI to address complex

   Realm of Generative Art},
Journal = {PSYCHOLOGY OF AESTHETICS CREATIVITY AND THE ARTS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 27},
Abstract = {Several decades ago, J. P. Guilford (1950) speculated that, although
   artificial intelligence (AI) might one day take over much of human
   thinking, creativity would remain a uniquely human faculty. However,
   rapid advancements in AI have led to the recent development of
   generative models that are capable of producing high-quality creative
   products, casting some doubt Guilford's prediction. Here, to shed light
   on this issue, we explored whether human creativity retains distinct
   value in the emerging domain of AI-assisted digital artworks. Using
   DALL-E 3, we generated images based on prompts crafted by professional
   artists, novice artists, and an AI chatbot (ChatGPT-4). Creativity
   ratings from 299 participants showed that images produced from
   professional artist prompts were rated as most creative, followed by
   those generated from AI chatbot prompts, with novice artist prompts
   rated lowest. Further analysis suggested that this pattern may be
   partially explained by the semantic distance of the prompts, which
   followed the same pattern (i.e., professionals > AI chatbot > novices).
   These findings suggest that, although AI demonstrates impressive
   creative abilities, the worth of human creativity has not been
   diminished in the domain of AI-assisted outputs, which supports
   Guilford's view on the enduring value of human creativity.},

Month = {2025 OCT 13},
Abstract = {Deterministic pseudorandom number generators used in generative
   artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns
   vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. Conventional defenses against
   the vulnerabilities often come with significant energy and latency
   overhead. Herein, hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer
   torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs) are embedded to address the
   challenges. A highly parallel, field-programmable gate array-assisted
   prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true random

   minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
   adversarial network trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up
   to 18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG)
   baseline. With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and
   established scalability, the STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to
   scale beyond 10(6) parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second
   throughput suitable for large language model sampling. This advancement

Abstract = {In this chapter, I address some of the issues that arise with the
   implementation of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), particularly
   when the replacement of human professionals by this technology may be
   deemed inappropriate. I argue that this situation arises when the work
   of human professionals is alienated to become mere data used to train
   GAI models that, in turn, replace those same professionals. The
   foundation of my argument lies not so much in the output of these
   models, but rather in the relationship of these outputs with both the
   users and the human professionals who have contributed directly or
   indirectly to their generation.},

   professional photographers, but it can also lead to serious economic
   crises in the photographic creative industry. Today, it is difficult to
   tell whether an image is AI generated or created by the usual
   photographic method using light. This fact contributes to the increase
   of so-called ``fake news{''} and creates a parallel virtual reality.
   The article examines the intersections between traditional photographic
   images and AI, but especially actual questions related to intellectual

Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Feedback is an essential component of the teaching-learning process;
   however, it can vary in quality due to different contexts and students'
   and professors' individual characteristics. This research explores the
   effect of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in strengthening
   personalized and timely feedback by initially defining an adaptable
   framework to integrate GenAI into feedback mechanisms defined in
   theoretical frameworks. We applied a between-subjects analysis in an
   experimental research design with 263 undergraduate students across
   multiple disciplines based on an approach consisting of a
   pretest-post-test process and control and focus groups to evaluate
   students' perceptions of artificial intelligence-enhanced feedback
   versus traditional professor-led feedback. The results show that
   students who used GenAI declared statistically significantly higher
   satisfaction levels and a greater sense of ownership in the feedback
   process. Additionally, GenAI scaffolded continuous improvement and
   active student participation through a structured and accessible
   feedback environment, determining that 97\% of students are willing to
   reuse the tool. These findings show that GenAI is a valuable tool to
   complement professors in the creation of an integrated feedback model.

Month = {APR 4},
Abstract = {The purpose of this work is to explore methods of visual communication
   based on generative artificial intelligence in the context of new media.
   This work proposes an image automatic generation and recognition model
   that integrates the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)
   with the Transformer algorithm. The generator component of the model
   takes noise vectors and conditional variables as inputs. Subsequently, a
   Transformer module is incorporated, where the multi-head self-attention
   mechanism enables the model to establish complex relationships among
   different data points. This is further refined through linear
   transformations and activation functions to enhance feature
   representations. Ultimately, the self-attention mechanism captures the
   long-range dependencies within images, facilitating the generation of
   high-quality images that meet specific conditions. The model's
   performance is assessed, and the findings show that the accuracy of the
   proposed model reaches 95.69\%, exceeding the baseline algorithm
   Generative Adversarial Network by more than 4\%. Additionally, the Peak
   Signal-to-Noise Ratio of the model's algorithm is 33dB, and the
   Structural Similarity Index is 0.83, indicating higher image generation
   quality and recognition accuracy. Therefore, the model proposed achieves
   high recognition and prediction accuracy of generated images, and higher
   image quality, promising significant application value in visual

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) is a new technology
   with potentially broad applications across important domains of
   healthcare, but serious questions remain about how to balance the
   promise of generative AI against unintended consequences from adoption
   of these tools. In this position statement, we provide recommendations
   on behalf of the Society of General Internal Medicine on how clinicians,
   technologists, and healthcare organizations can approach the use of
   these tools. We focus on three major domains of medical practice where
   clinicians and technology experts believe generative AI will have
   substantial immediate and long-term impacts: clinical decision-making,
   health systems optimization, and the patient-physician relationship.
   Additionally, we highlight our most important generative AI ethics and
   equity considerations for these stakeholders. For clinicians, we
   recommend approaching generative AI similarly to other important
   biomedical advancements, critically appraising its evidence and utility
   and incorporating it thoughtfully into practice. For technologists
   developing generative AI for healthcare applications, we recommend a
   major frameshift in thinking away from the expectation that clinicians
   will ``supervise{''} generative AI. Rather, these organizations and
   individuals should hold themselves and their technologies to the same
   set of high standards expected of the clinical workforce and strive to
   design high-performing, well-studied tools that improve care and foster
   the therapeutic relationship, not simply those that improve efficiency
   or market share. We further recommend deep and ongoing partnerships with
   clinicians and patients as necessary collaborators in this work. And for
   healthcare organizations, we recommend pursuing a combination of both
   incremental and transformative change with generative AI, directing
   resources toward both endeavors, and avoiding the urge to rapidly
   displace the human clinical workforce with generative AI. We affirm that
   the practice of medicine remains a fundamentally human endeavor which
   should be enhanced by technology, not displaced by it.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This cross-sectional study assessed a generative artificial
   intelligence platform to automate the creation of accurate, appropriate,
   and compelling social media (SoMe) posts from urological journal
   articles. Materials and Methods: One hundred SoMe posts from the top 3
   journals in urology X (formerly Twitter) profiles were collected from
   August 2022 to October 2023. A freeware generative pre-trained
   transformer (GPT) tool was developed to autogenerate SoMe posts, which
   included title summarization, key findings, pertinent emojis, hashtags,
   and digital object identifier links to the article. Three physicians
   independently evaluated GPT-generated posts for achieving tetrafecta of
   accuracy and appropriateness criteria. Fifteen scenarios were created
   from 5 randomly selected posts from each journal. Each scenario
   contained both the original and the GPT-generated post for the same
   article. Five questions were formulated to investigate the posts'
   likability, shareability, engagement, understandability, and
   comprehensiveness. The paired posts were then randomized and presented
   to blinded academic authors and general public through Amazon Mechanical
   Turk (AMT) responders for preference evaluation. Results: Median time
   for post autogeneration was 10.2 seconds (interquartile range 8.5-12.5).
   Of the 150 rated GPT-generated posts, 115 (76.6\%) met the correctness
   tetrafecta: 144 (96\%) accurately summarized the title, 147 (98\%)
   accurately presented the articles' main findings, 131 (87.3\%)
   appropriately used emojis, and 138 (92\%) appropriately used hashtags. A
   total of 258 academic urologists and 493 AMT responders answered the
   surveys, wherein the GPT-generated posts consistently outperformed the
   original journals' posts for both academicians and AMT responders (P <
   .05). Conclusions: Generative artificial intelligence can automate the
   creation of SoMe posts from urology journal abstracts that are both
   accurate and preferable by the academic community and general public.},

Abstract = {Free access to powerful generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
   schools has left educators and system leaders grappling with how to
   responsibly respond to the consequent challenges and opportunities that
   this new technology poses. This paper examines the priorities and
   challenges that senior Australian educational leaders identify with
   relation to responsible and ethical use of generative AI in school
   education, and the reasons for their beliefs. Members of the Australian
   generative Artificial Intelligence in Education working group as well as
   other senior policymakers throughout Australia participated in a
   two-phase data collection process involving survey responses and focus
   group discussions. Ranking activities revealed a large number of
   priorities and systemic challenges, with no unilateral consensuses
   emerging. The highest priorities for senior policymakers related to
   managing risks, educating teachers, and educating system leaders, while
   the main systemic and environmental challenges related to the pace of
   change, teacher capabilities and professional learning, and equitable
   access to the technology. Throughout the analysis, meta themes emerged
   that characterised the policy-setting environment as one involving
   urgency, uncertainty, interconnectedness, contextuality, and complexity,
   with the pivotal role of teachers highlighted throughout. Reflections on
   responsible and ethical policy-setting in response to rapid
   technological change are provided, including with relation to
   anticipatory and networked governance and the inter-relationship with
   the broader policy context. Recommendations for further research and
   practice are also proposed.},

   Generative AI: Taking Tang Poetry as an Example},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {1353-1366},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is widely recognized as one of
   the most influential technologies for the future, having sparked a
   paradigm shift in scientific research. The field of education has also
   been greatly impacted by this transformative technology, with
   researchers exploring the applications of generative AI, particularly
   ChatGPT, in education. However, existing research primarily focuses on
   generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of
   studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key
   challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we
   present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational
   videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need
   for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main
   modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video
   generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation
   system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text
   generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation,
   text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy
   of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation
   system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent
   text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical
   findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that
   exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a
   better comprehension of the poem's connotations and its key components.
   Concurrently, the Tang poetry videos generated can significantly
   contribute to the reduction of cognitive load and the enhancement of
   understanding during the learning process. Our research showcases the
   potential of generative AI in the education field, specifically in the
   domain of multimodal teaching resources.},

   in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research
   tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to
   investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT's output often aligned
   with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands,
   ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic
   authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in
   evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical
   concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact,
   issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright
   infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of
   ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations.
   ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science
   units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any
   AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts.

   how advances in computational infrastructure, algorithms, and
   large-scale modeling are converging to drive the generative AI
   revolution and shaping the trajectory toward AGI, potentially within the
   next 5-to-10 years. Specifically, we analyze recent progress in compute

   experiences. Despite the advancement of AI technology, limited research
   has been conducted on the impact of AI on a more profound cognitive
   impact, particularly on students' ability to think critically and
   independently. This scoping review examines how AI influences ESL
   learners' critical thinking and writing skills. Using the Preferred

   framework, this study synthesizes findings from 15 peer-reviewed
   articles published between 2023 and 2025 to answer the research
   questions: How does AI affect critical thinking development? Moreover,
   2) What are the ethical concerns resulting from AI-assisted learning?
   This study conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to discover
   in-depth insights on the over-reliance on generative AI techniques and
   the development of critical thinking skills in the context of ESL
   writing to contribute to the existing literature. Results indicate that
   while AI significantly enhances writing quality and critical thinking
   skills, excessive reliance on AI tools may hinder independent learning.

Abstract = {Crystal structure prediction (CSP) represents a fundamental research
   frontier in computational materials science and chemistry, aiming to
   predict thermodynamically stable periodic structures from given chemical
   compositions. Traditional methods often face challenges such as high
   computational costs and local minima trapping. Recently, artificial
   intelligence methods, represented by generative adversarial networks
   (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), diffusion models, and large
   language models (LLMs), have revolutionized the traditional prediction
   paradigm. These computational frameworks efficiently extract chemical
   rules and structural features from crystal databases, significantly
   reducing computational costs while maintaining prediction accuracy. This
   Perspective systematically evaluates the advantages and limitations of
   various generative models, explores their synergies with conventional
   approaches, and discusses their future prospects in accelerating
   materials discovery and development, providing new insights for future
   research directions.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the hospitality

   causal recipes for loyalty. The findings reveal that cognitive and
   emotional variables, such as perceived behavioural control and emotional
   well-being are important and necessary conditions for customer loyalty

Title = {Generative AI of things for sustainable smart cities: Synergizing
   cognitive augmentation, resource efficiency, network traffic,
   cybersecurity, and anomaly detection for environmental performance},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {133},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has emerged as a transformative
   technology driving environmental sustainability in smart city
   development. However, the integration of Generative Artificial
   Intelligence (GenAI) within AIoT ecosystems remains largely unexplored.
   Current research predominantly addresses conventional AIoT frameworks,
   overlooking the innovative potential of generative models, such as
   Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, Diffusion
   Models, Transformers, and hybrid architectures, to significantly enhance
   situational awareness, system optimization, operational robustness,
   real-time responsiveness, and adaptive decision-making in complex urban
   environments. AIoT systems continue to face persistent challenges,
   including data scarcity, poor data quality, limited adaptability,
   imbalanced datasets, and inadequate contextawareness. This study
   addresses these gaps by systematically exploring how GenAI can enhance
   AIoT functionalities across key domains-namely cognitive augmentation,
   resource efficiency, network traffic, cybersecurity, and anomaly
   detection-while examining their synergistic potential to improve
   system-level environmental performance across two interconnected layers
   in sustainable smart cities. At the operational layer, key findings
   reveal that integrating GenAI with AIoT systems enhances urban
   efficiency, adaptability, autonomy, robustness, and resilience by
   conserving resources, optimizing network traffic flows, securing
   infrastructures, and detecting anomalies before they escalate.
   Specifically, the fusion of generative intelligence with federated
   learning promotes sustainable, energy-efficient AIoT deployments by
   reducing data transmission, thereby lowering communication overhead and
   safeguarding user privacy. In networked environments, generative models
   improve synthetic traffic realism and communication efficiency. They
   also strengthen cybersecurity through enhanced intrusion prevention and
   threat detection. Additionally, they enable early identification and
   mitigation of anomalies, boosting operational efficiency and system
   robustness. These improvements stabilize sustainable smart city system
   functioning and prevent disruptive failures. At the environmental layer,
   as key findings indicate, these operational gains cascade into indirect
   but tangible ecological benefits, while generative models advance the
   core pillars of AIoT by enabling proactive, autonomous, context-aware,
   and self-adaptive systems that further enhance the environmental
   performance of sustainable smart cities. Thus, while the five domains
   primarily underpin the operational backbone of urban systems, their
   cascading effects extend to ecological outcomes. The proposed conceptual
   framework, distilled from key findings, integrates GenAI and AIoT and
   highlights both domain-specific advancements and their synergistic
   interactions. This framework holds significant potential to drive
   sustainable smart city development by fostering AIoT ecosystems that are
   more intelligent, resource-efficient, adaptive, secure, robust, and
   autonomous through the strategic application of generative intelligence.
   The insights gained from this study provide policymakers, urban
   planners, system designers, and technology developers with practical
   guidance to harness GAIoT for enhancing smart city resilience,
   sustainability, and operational intelligence.},

   convergent mixed-methods design linked classroom observation, digital
   artefact review and reflective interviews, thereby ensuring a holistic
   understanding of the phenomenon. Ethical protocols were applied,
   confidentiality was preserved, and rigorous standards were observed to
   guarantee methodological reproducibility. The technological integration
   was characterised by task personalisation, metacognitive mediation and
   dynamic coordination between human resources and algorithms. The
   findings revealed more active student participation, strengthened

   schemes, and enhancing privacy. Moreover, we present a case study to
   demonstrate that GAI, specifically the generative diffusion model, can
   be employed to optimize blockchain network performance metrics.
   Experimental results clearly show that, compared to a baseline
   traditional AI approach, the proposed generative diffusion model
   approach can converge faster, achieve higher rewards, and significantly
   improve the throughput and latency of the blockchain network.
   Additionally, we highlight future research directions for GAI in
   blockchain applications, including personalized GAI-enabled blockchains,
   GAI-blockchain synergy, and privacy and security considerations within
   blockchain ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
   attracted global attention and posed challenges to existing data
   governance frameworks. The increased technical complexity and expanded
   scale of data usage not only make it more difficult to regulate AI but
   also present challenges for the current legal system. This article,
   which takes ChatGPT's training data and working principles as a starting
   point, examines specific privacy risks, data leakage risks, and personal
   data risks posed by generative AI. It also analyzes the latest practices
   in privacy and personal data protection in China. This article finds
   that while China's governance on privacy and personal data protection
   takes a macro-micro integration approach and a private-and-public law
   integration approach, there are shortcomings in the legal system. Given
   that the current personal data protection system centered on individual
   control is unsuitable for the modes of data processing by generative AI,
   and that private law is insufficient in safeguarding data privacy,
   urgent institutional innovation is needed to achieve the objective of
   ``trustworthy AI.{''}},

Abstract = {Generative design tools empowered by recent advancements in artificial

   tools to collaborate in new, more advanced modes throughout various
   stages of the product design process to facilitate the creation of
   higher performing and more complex products. This paper explores how the
   use of these generative design tools may impact the design process,
   designer behavior, and overall outcomes. Six in-depth interviews were
   conducted with practicing and student designers from different
   disciplines who use commercial generative design tools, detailing the
   design processes they followed. From a grounded theory-based analysis of
   the interviews, a provisional process diagram for generative design and
   its uses in the early-stage design process is proposed. The early stages
   of defining tool inputs bring about a constraint-driven process in which
   designers focus on the abstraction of the design problem. Designers will
   iterate through the inputs to improve both quantitative and qualitative
   metrics. The learning through iteration allows designers to gain a
   thorough understanding of the design problem and solution space. This
   can bring about creative applications of generative design tools in
   early-stage design to provide guidance for traditionally designed

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is emerging as a disruptive
   force, both economically and socially, with its use spanning from the
   provision of goods and services to everyday activities such as
   healthcare and household management. This study analyzes the enabling
   and inhibiting factors of GAI use in Spain based on a large-scale survey
   conducted by the Spanish Center for Sociological Research on the use and
   perception of artificial intelligence. The proposed model is based on
   the Theory of Planned Behavior and is fitted using machine learning
   techniques, specifically decision trees, Random Forest extensions, and
   extreme gradient boosting. While decision trees allow for detailed
   visualization of how variables interact to explain usage, Random Forest
   provides an excellent model fit (R2 close to 95\%) and predictive
   performance. The use of Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that
   knowledge about artificial intelligence, followed by innovation
   orientation, is the main explanatory variable of GAI use. Among
   sociodemographic variables, Generation X and Z stood out as the most
   relevant. It is also noteworthy that the perceived privacy risk does not
   show a clear inhibitory influence on usage. Factors representing the
   positive consequences of GAI, such as performance expectancy and social
   utility, exert a stronger influence than the negative impact of
   hindering factors such as perceived privacy or social risks.},

Abstract = {The introduction of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
   revolutionized healthcare and education. These AI systems, trained on
   vast datasets using advanced machine learning (ML) techniques and large
   language models (LLMs), can generate text, images, and videos, offering
   new avenues for enhancing surgical education. Their ability to produce
   interactive learning resources, procedural guidance, and feedback
   post-virtual simulations makes them valuable in educating surgical
   trainees. However, technical challenges such as data quality issues,
   inaccuracies, and uncertainties around model interpretability remain
   barriers to widespread adoption. This review explores the integration of
   generative AI into surgical training, assessing its potential to enhance
   learning and teaching methodologies. While generative AI has
   demonstrated promise for improving surgical education, its integration
   must be approached cautiously, ensuring AI input is balanced with
   traditional supervision and mentorship from experienced surgeons. Given
   that generative AI models are not yet suitable as standalone tools, a
   blended learning approach that integrates AI capabilities with
   conventional educational strategies should be adopted. The review also
   addresses limitations and challenges, emphasizing the need for more
   robust research on different AI models and their applications across
   various surgical subspecialties. The lack of standardized frameworks and
   tools to assess the quality of AI outputs in surgical education
   necessitates rigorous oversight to ensure accuracy and reliability in
   training settings. By evaluating the current state of generative AI in

Abstract = {PurposeThis study investigates how entrepreneurship education influences
   e-entrepreneurial intention through e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy,
   with generative artificial intelligence incorporation as a moderating
   factor. The study uses the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework to
   comprehensively understand the relationship between educational,
   psychological and technological factors in fostering e-entrepreneurship
   among university students.Design/methodology/approachA quantitative
   study was conducted using survey data collected from 504 university
   students in Vietnam. The PROCESS macro was employed to test the
   mediating role of e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy and the moderating
   effect of generative artificial intelligence incorporation on the
   relationships among entrepreneurship education, e-entrepreneurial
   self-efficacy and intention.FindingsThe results demonstrate that
   entrepreneurship education significantly influences both
   e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy and intention. E-entrepreneurial
   self-efficacy mediates the relationship between entrepreneurship
   education and intention. Generative artificial intelligence
   incorporation amplifies the effects of entrepreneurship education and
   e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy on intention, both directly and
   indirectly, highlighting its role as a transformative driver in
   e-entrepreneurship.Practical implicationsThe findings suggest that
   integrating generative artificial intelligence tools and
   entrepreneurship-focused education into training programs can enhance
   students' digital entrepreneurial skills. Policymakers and educators
   should develop strategies to foster digital literacy and entrepreneurial
   competence to prepare students for technology-driven business
   environments.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature
   by extending the stimulus-organism-response framework to
   e-entrepreneurship. It uniquely integrates educational, psychological
   and technological factors, offering new insights into the mechanisms

Title = {The transformative roles of generative artificial intelligence in vision
   techniques for structural health monitoring: A state-of-the-art review},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {68},
Number = {B},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As urbanization accelerates, aging infrastructure demands more advanced
   inspection methods for structural health monitoring. The growing
   integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision
   technologies has significantly enhanced damage detection accuracy while
   simultaneously reducing inspection time and operational costs. Despite
   these advantages, the adoption of AI-based technologies in
   infrastructure maintenance remains limited due to challenges related to
   data. One major issue is the lack of comprehensive, task-specific
   annotated datasets. Another is the poor quality of images captured by
   drones or mobile devices, which are often affected by noise, blurring,
   and inconsistent lighting. Although recent advances in generative AI
   offer promising support for structural health monitoring, it remains
   unclear which models are best suited for specific tasks. This study
   examines the use of generative AI in structural health monitoring,
   focusing on key challenges such as limited datasets and low-quality
   image restoration. The review covers a range of generative AI
   technologies, outlining their principles, strengths, limitations, and
   representative applications to support the selection of appropriate
   tools for specific tasks. Generative AI models enable accurate image
   segmentation and structural anomaly detection using limited training
   data. The paper also explores new opportunities for integrating
   multimodal generative AI to enhance human-computer interaction in
   support of structural health monitoring. A framework is proposed to
   streamline the use of generative AI technologies for data augmentation,
   image restoration, damage inspection, and human-computer interaction in
   structural health monitoring.},

Title = {Can Generative Artificial Intelligence be a Good Teaching Assistant?-An
   Empirical Analysis Based on Generative AI-Assisted Teaching},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {BackgroundGenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promise in
   enhancing personalised learning and improving educational efficiency.
   However, its integration into education raises concerns about
   misinformation and over-reliance, particularly among adolescents.
   Teacher supervision plays a critical role in mitigating these risks and
   ensuring the effective use of Generative AI in classrooms. Despite the
   growing interest in Generative AI, there is limited empirical research
   on its actual impact and the role of teacher oversight.ObjectiveThe
   purpose of this study is to systematically assess the role of Generative
   AI in classroom teaching, with a specific focus on how teacher
   supervision shapes its effectiveness.MethodThis study employed a
   quasi-experimental design to examine differences in learning outcomes
   among students under three instructional methods: traditional
   computer-assisted teaching, Generative AI-assisted teaching without
   teacher supervision and Generative AI-assisted teaching with teacher
   supervision. The study was implemented in the context of a two-week
   Information Science and Technology course in a middle school, involving
   three classes with 45, 41 and 45 students, respectively. To ensure
   consistency in teaching styles, all classes were taught by the same
   experienced teacher. Data collection included a knowledge test to assess
   knowledge mastery, as well as questionnaires to measure learning
   satisfaction and engagement. The collected data were analysed using
   one-way ANOVA to compare the effectiveness of the three teaching
   methods.Results and ConclusionCompared with traditional
   computer-assisted teaching, Generative AI-assisted teaching can
   significantly enhance students' learning satisfaction, but can not
   improve their learning engagement and knowledge mastery level.
   Furthermore, in the process of Generative AI-assisted teaching, teacher
   supervision can significantly increase students' learning engagement and
   knowledge mastery compared with situations without teacher supervision.
   This study indicated Generative AI's potential as an educational tool
   and underscored the essential role of teacher
   supervision.ImplicationsThis study fills a critical gap by providing
   empirical evidence on how Generative AI and teacher supervision interact
   to improve classroom learning outcomes. It shows that Generative AI's
   potential to enhance learning outcomes is significantly amplified with
   teacher oversight.},

Abstract = {The widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools
   has profoundly impacted higher education, reshaping how knowledge is

   advocates for a renewed culture of academic integrity that incorporates
   comprehensive AI ethics training across the academic community. This
   approach goes beyond simplistic prohibitions to address the broader
   ethical, social, technical, and normative issues that underpin academic
   integrity in the use of AI tools. By fostering awareness and competence
   in AI ethics, it seeks to equip students, educators, and administrators
   with the skills to critically engage with AI technologies, promote

   primarily fall into four patterns: cooperation, control and guidance,
   support and dependency, as well as competition and conflict. Although
   existing research extensively discusses GAI's potential, this study

Abstract = {A leading critic of the disruptive force of technology in education,
   Bernard Stiegler saw the counter-effects of artificial intelligence in
   undermining human agency, autonomy and individuality, rendering the role
   of education ever more critical. Stiegler believes that our goal is not
   to abandon technology but to focus our attention on its power and
   direction in a hypercapitalist economy. While he did not foresee the
   emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), its rapid
   acceleration raises important issues for his notion of digital writing
   as a pharmakon. In this essay, we examine Stiegler's view on
   intelligence, digital writing, technological memory, and neuropower,
   focusing specifically on his Shanghai lecture and Nanjing Lectures. We
   compare Stiegler with Catherine Malabou, who examines the nature of
   intelligence primarily through the lens of neuroscience. We argue that
   Malabou's view of neuroplasticity in human and artificial brains, and
   her critique of techno-narcissism in the control over technology, add an
   important dimension to Stiegler's political critique of education.
   Finally, we examine how best to construe AI as part of a
   hyper-materialist epistemology that Stiegler espouses in the conclusion
   of his Nanjing Lectures, to bring about neganthropic knowledge through a

   research examines the effects of generative AI (ChatGPT-4) and social
   media use on young students' academic performance and psychological
   well-being, focusing on CL. The study conceptual framework was examined
   based on a sample of 441 Chinese university students. The statistical
   technique PLS-SEM is put into practice to measure the structural
   framework of academic performance and psychological well-being. The
   findings of this study show that generative AI (ChatGPT-4) and social
   media positively influence young students' academic performance and

   study show that CL positively mediates between social media, academic
   performance and psychological well-being. Conversely, it negatively
   mediates the association between generative AI (ChatGPT-4), academic
   performance (AP), and psychological well-being. The findings can
   facilitate a better understanding of the implications of technologies in

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has immense potential to create
   diverse computer graphics for various applications, but it also raises
   significant ethical issues. This article examines the ethical landscape
   of using generative AI in computer graphics, highlighting key concerns,
   such as the authenticity of generated content, intellectual property
   rights, and cultural appropriation. Additional ethical challenges
   include algorithmic bias in graphics generation, representation,
   privacy, inclusivity, and the impact on human-computer interaction and
   artistic integrity. The displacement of creative professionals, erosion
   of trust in visual media, and psychological effects of AI-generated

Abstract = {This review focuses on the transformative applications of deep learning
   and artificial intelligence in textile dyeing, printing, and finishing.
   In textile dyeing, the topics span color prediction, color-based
   classification, dyeing recipe prediction, dyeing pattern recognition,
   and the nuanced domain of color fabric defect detection. In textile
   printing, applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning
   center around pattern detection in printed fabrics, the generation of
   novel patterns, and the critical task of detecting defects in printed
   textiles. In textile finishing the prediction of fabric thermosetting
   parameters is discussed. Artificial neural networks, diverse
   convolutional neural network variations like AlexNet, traditional
   machine learning approaches including support vector regression,
   principal component analysis, XGBoost, and generative artificial
   intelligence such as generative adversarial networks, as well as genetic
   algorithms all find application in this multifaceted exploration. At its
   core, the interest to use these methodologies is because of the need to
   minimize repetitive and time-consuming manual tasks, curtail prototyping
   costs, and promote process automation. The review unravels a plethora of
   innovative architectures and frameworks, each tailored to address
   specific challenges. However, a persistent hurdle looms - the scarcity
   of data, which remains a significant impediment. While unveiling a
   collection of research findings, the review also spotlights the inherent
   challenges in implementing artificial intelligence solutions in the
   textile dyeing and printing domain.},

   EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {3},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI)
   technologies has ushered in a new era of potential applications across
   various industries. The value of this technology has been increasingly
   recognized, with integration having the potential to revolutionize both
   training and practice. However, there is currently a lack of governance
   policies and best practices with this technology with respect to
   surgical education. We set out to redress this research gap by
   conducting a thematic analysis using Braun's principles of generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) technologies' policies, standards, and
   governance frameworks across multiple industries.MethodsThe methodology
   involved a thorough examination of policies, guidelines, and
   communications from nine selected industries, including insurance,
   finance, sports, legal, government, academic, airlines, pharmaceutical,
   and automotive sectors. Three experts with diverse industry backgrounds
   and with shared backgrounds in surgical education, conducted
   line-by-line coding of 42 documents, using both deductive and inductive
   approaches. This process identified key themes related to the uses,
   risks, and mitigants of generative AI.ResultsThe results revealed four
   primary risk categories: privacy, inaccuracy, equity, and intellectual
   property. Additionally, four risk mitigant categories emerged:
   regulation and monitoring, application of existing policies,
   accountability, and transparency. This qualitative summary provides a
   foundational framework to understand the landscape of generative AI best
   practices and guidelines in the context of surgical
   education.ConclusionsWe outline a framework to guide ethical
   consideration when integrating generative AI into surgical education.
   Use cases demonstrate how the framework may be used by decision-makers
   across 4 surgical education applications. The results of this study
   provide a preliminary basis of cross-industrial themes to guide best
   practices and governance standards for integration of generative AI into
   surgical education.},

Abstract = {The controversy surrounding ChatGPT has reopened the debate about the
   impact of new technologies in many fields of activities, including
   communication and PR. This study mapped Romanian PR practitioners' use
   of generative AI and their perception of it, placing a special focus on
   the ethical concerns involved and the implications for the profession
   itself. We took a quantitative-qualitative approach by using both a
   survey and semi-structured interviews. Our goal was to determine the
   impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the Romanian PR
   industry and to understand the reasons and challenges behind integrating
   generative AI in PR practice. The survey findings revealed a substantial
   adoption (73.5\%) of AI within the Romanian PR community, with an
   overwhelming 91.6\% of them using ChatGPT. The satisfaction level was
   remarkably high, with 92\% expressing satisfaction with generative AI
   application efficacy. Benefits included timesaving, work simplification,
   and the reduction of repetitive tasks. Surprisingly, not only did 67.3\%
   of respondents not perceive AI as an immediate threat to PR jobs, but
   80.5\% believed AI represents an opportunity for the industry. Indeed,
   almost all our interviewees admitted relief and satisfaction when using
   generative AI tools to complete their tasks. However, some concerns were
   expressed regarding the quality of the generative AI content and, in
   particular, the need to always check this kind of content by a human
   editor before using it. Moreover, PR professionals' main ethical
   concerns are related to the issue of transparency towards their clients
   when using AI tools to produce different types of content.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative technologies, and
   large language models are transforming modern education. On the one
   hand, these tools can automate certain aspects of teaching, personalize
   educational materials, and improve learning efficiency. However,
   concerns are emerging regarding the impact of AI on the quality of
   education, the mental health of students, and fundamental academic
   values. This article reviews the scientific literature on the
   applications of artificial intelligence in education, with a special
   emphasis on its impact on student mental health. Based on an analysis of
   120 scientific articles, the study automatically extracted data on AI
   implementation's potential opportunities and threats. A novel aspect of
   this work is identifying factors that can be considered both
   opportunities and threats depending on context. In addition, a frequency
   analysis of keywords and phrases uncovered many opportunities and
   challenges. All identified aspects are characterized in the article. The
   article also highlights key barriers to using large language models
   (LLMs) for detecting student mental health issues, such as
   underestimating suicide risk, difficulties with interpreting subtle
   language, biases in training data, lack of cultural sensitivity, and
   unresolved ethical concerns. These challenges illustrate why generative
   AI is not yet reliable for supporting student mental health, especially
   in high-risk situations. One of the key conclusions is that the use of
   generative AI to support student mental health is seldom addressed in
   existing review articles, likely due to the current unreliability of
   this technology.},

   in machine learning techniques. However, research on GenAI in creative
   contexts remains in its early stages, with few attempts made to assess
   the current body of research or synthesise the existing knowledge in

   literature review of 64 studies to identify methods, research trends and
   key thematic insights shaping the current understanding of GenAI in
   creative contexts. The findings of this systematic literature review
   emphasise the rapid development of research on GenAI in creative
   contexts. The analysis highlights key factors influencing the adoption
   and impact of GenAI in creative processes, as well as the implications
   for creative outcomes and industry practices. From this analysis,
   several potential directions for future research emerge, including the
   long-term effects of GenAI on creative processes, socio-economic
   implications for creative industries, and frameworks for ethical use,

Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is transforming various
   sectors, including healthcare, offering both promising opportunities and
   notable risks. The infancy and rapid development of GenAI raises
   questions regarding its effective, safe, and ethical use by health
   professionals, including clinical exercise physiologists. This narrative
   review aims to explore existing interdisciplinary literature and
   summarise the ethical and practical considerations of integrating GenAI
   into clinical exercise physiology practice. Specifically, it examines
   the `promises' of improved exercise programming and healthcare delivery,
   as well as the `perils' related to data privacy, person-centred care,
   and equitable access. Recommendations for the responsible integration of
   GenAI in clinical exercise physiology are described, in addition to
   recommendations for future research to address gaps in knowledge. Future
   directions, including the roles and responsibilities of specific

Title = {A Little of that Human Touch: How Regular Journalists Redefine Their
   Expertise in the Face of Artificial Intelligence},

Abstract = {Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence raise
   fundamental questions about its impact on the journalistic profession
   and the future role of journalists in news production. However, the
   attitudes of regular journalists towards artificial intelligence remain
   largely unexplored. We address this gap by investigating the potentials
   and concerns that Danish journalists attribute to the impact of
   artificial intelligence on journalism. Journalists largely acknowledge
   its potential to streamline news production. While they also express
   broader concerns about the trustworthiness of journalism and the risk of
   job displacement, their more immediate worry lies in the impact of
   artificial intelligence on job meaningfulness and professional identity.
   These findings reveal a differentiated perspective on the
   profession-wide and individual impacts of artificial intelligence on
   journalism. Furthermore, journalists emphasise their human qualities and
   skills such as nuanced judgement, empathy, and creativity as beyond
   artificial intelligence's capabilities. This indicates that artificial
   intelligence prompts journalists to reshape their expertise to
   prioritise the human touch in journalism, suggesting a broadened view of
   the journalistic profession. By examining these perceptions among
   regular journalists, this study contributes to a better understanding of
   the multifaceted challenges that artificial intelligence poses to both
   individual journalistic practices and the broader profession.},

Title = {Integrating generative AI with neurophysiological methods in psychiatric
   practice},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper explores the potential integration of generative AI (e.g.,
   large language models) with neuroscientific and physiological approaches
   in psychiatric practice. Renowned for its advanced natural language
   processing capabilities, generative AI has shown promise in
   psychological counseling, emotional support, and clinical interventions.
   However, its application alongside neuroscience and physiology in
   psychiatry remains underexplored. We propose that generative AI can
   facilitate translations and adaptive explanations, streamline
   experimental preparation, enhance multi-modal data analysis, and improve
   clinical applications through realtime communication, content
   generation, and data synthesis. Furthermore, we examine how generative
   AI, as a specialized application of deep learning, can identify new
   biomarkers and construct neurophysiological models of psychiatric
   symptoms. We also discuss the synergistic relationship between
   neuroscience and AI development, particularly in improving AI's
   emotional recognition and learning mechanisms. While acknowledging the
   potential benefits, we address the challenges and risks associated with
   generative AI in psychiatry, including data reliability, privacy
   concerns, and resource constraints. This perspective advocates for a
   balanced approach to leveraging AI's capabilities while safeguarding
   mental health.},

   80.00\% of items (n = 216) violated at least one guideline, with 73.70\%
   (n = 199) likely to produce major measurement error (should not use
   without revision), 6.30\% (n = 17) likely to elicit minor measurement
   error (consider modifying), and 20.00\% (n = 54) acceptable (usable as

   Comparison of Four Tiers of Chinese Media},
Journal = {JOURNALISM PRACTICE},

Month = {2025 OCT 24},
Abstract = {Guided by technology appropriation theory, this study investigates the
   adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) across China's
   four-tier media system through interviews with 44 journalists. Although
   GAI technologies are widely accessible and have low barriers to entry,
   their depth and innovativeness of use vary considerably across
   institutional levels, shaped by both structural and agentic factors.
   National-level media prioritize compliance and social responsibility;
   provincial and municipal outlets emphasize efficiency and innovation;
   county-level media, meanwhile, often adopt GAI defensively. The
   diffusion of GAI in Chinese journalism thus reflects cautious and
   selective empowerment rather than wholesale replacement, with core
   journalistic functions remaining irreplaceable by AI. The findings
   reveal a dynamic digital divide within Chinese media, influenced by
   stratification, mobility, and policy support. This study advances
   understanding of technology appropriation and digital inequality in
   emerging technology contexts, providing empirical insights for China and
   the broader Global South.},

Abstract = {Traditional nephrology education faces challenges due to expanding
   medical knowledge, case complexity, and personalized learning needs.
   Generative artificial intelligence (AI), like ChatGPT, offers potential
   solutions to enhance nephrology education through dynamic, adaptive, and
   personalized learning experiences. We discuss integrating generative AI
   into nephrology education at our institution, highlighting its
   importance and potential applications. It explores how AI can complement
   traditional teaching methods by addressing challenges like information
   overload, diverse learning needs, and continuous learning. Generative AI
   models should be actively utilized under human supervision to ensure
   accuracy when summarizing key teaching points, creating discussion
   topics for journal clubs, and aiding in curriculum development for our
   Nephrology fellowship. Potential future applications include
   simulation-based learning, interactive learning modules, personalized
   learning plans, and enhanced research capabilities. AI can also
   facilitate mentorship, improve assessment, and support administrative
   tasks. The integration of AI addresses challenges such as keeping pace
   with knowledge expansion, providing personalized learning experiences,
   and improving access to expertise. In summary, the integration of
   generative AI into nephrology education represents a paradigm shift in
   preparing future kidney specialists. While AI offers numerous benefits,
   challenges such as data privacy and maintaining the human element in

Abstract = {Background Ambient artificial intelligence scribes have become
   widespread commercial products in the era of generative artificial
   intelligence. While studies have examined the effect of these tools on
   the experience of attending physicians, little evidence is available
   regarding their use by resident physician trainees. Objectives To assess
   trainee experience with an ambient artificial intelligence scribe using
   measures of usability, acceptability, and documentation burden. Methods
   This prospective observational study enrolled 47 trainees in a 2-month
   pilot. Pre/postsurveys were conducted with the NASA Task Load Index
   (NASA-TLX, raw unweighted form, pre/post, for cognitive load during the
   documentation), the System Usability Scale (post; general usability),
   the Net Promoter Score (post; acceptability), and the AMIA TrendBurden
   Survey (pre/post; documentation burden). Electronic health record
   utilization metrics were obtained from Epic Signal for both the pilot
   period and a 6-month baseline. Results In total, 43/47 (91.5\%) of
   participants adopted the intervention in practice. NASA-TLX scores
   improved from 56.3 to 43.3 (p < 0.001), and multiple items on the
   TrendBurden survey improved with high measures of acceptability. No
   significant difference in time spent on notes activity per note written
   was observed, with a median increase of 0.4 minutes ( p = 0.568).
   Conclusion Trainee use of an ambient artificial intelligence scribe was
   associated with improvements in documentation burden. Additional
   research on the effect of this technology on trainee learning and
   expertise development is needed.},

Title = {Using Machine Learning and Generative Intelligence in Book Cover
   Development},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF IMAGING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence
   approaches is finding ever wider application in various areas of life.
   This paper considers the problem of improving editorial and publishing
   processes, namely self-publishing, when designing book covers using
   machine learning and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) methods.
   When choosing a book, readers often have certain expectations regarding
   the design of the publication, including the color of the cover. These
   expectations can be called color preferences, and they can depend on the
   genre of the book, its target audience, and even personal associations.
   Cultural context can also influence color choice, as certain colors can
   symbolize different emotions or moods in different cultures. Cluster
   analysis of book cover images of the same genre allows us to identify
   color preferences inherent in the genre, which is proposed to be used
   when designing new covers. The capabilities of generative services for
   creating and improving cover designs are also investigated. An improved
   flow chart for using GAI in creating book covers in the process of
   self-publishing is proposed, which includes new stages, namely
   exploring, conditioning, and evolving. At these stages, the designer
   creates prompts for GAI and examines how they and GAI's issuances
   correspond to the task. Conditioning allows for even more precise
   adjustment of prompts to features of each book, and the evolving stage
   also includes post-processing of results already received from GAI.
   Post-processing, in turn, can be performed both in generative services
   and by a designer. The experiment allowed us to use the machine-learning
   method to determine which colors are most often found in book cover
   layouts of one of the genres and to check whether these colors
   correspond to harmonious color palettes. In accordance with the proposed
   scheme of the design process using generative artificial intelligence,
   versions of book cover layouts of a given genre were obtained.},

Abstract = {The influence of Artificial Intelligence in our society is becoming
   important due to the possibility of carrying out analysis of the large
   amount of data that the increasing number of interconnected devices
   capture and send as well as making autonomous and instant decisions from
   the information that machines are now able to extract, saving time and
   efforts in some determined tasks, specially in the cyberspace. One of
   the key issues concerns security of this cyberspace that is controlled
   by machines, so the system can run properly. A particular situation,
   given the heterogeneous and special nature of the environment, is the
   case of IoT. The limited resources of some components in such a network
   and the distributed nature of the topology make these types of
   environments vulnerable to many different attacks and information
   leakages. The capability of Generative Artificial Intelligence to
   generate contents and to autonomously learn and predict situations can
   be very useful for making decisions automatically and instantly,
   significantly enhancing the security of IoT systems. Our aim in this

Title = {Effect of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Strategic
   Decision-Making in Entrepreneurial Business Initiatives: A Systematic
   Literature Review},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is emerging as a promising tool
   with which to improve strategic decision-making in a business
   environment characterized by increasing complexity. There are external
   and internal factors that are part of the success of entrepreneurial
   initiatives. Relevant factors that make decision-making effective
   include the technological environment, as an external factor, and
   innovation, as an internal factor. Methods: This study reviews the
   existing literature on implementing GAI in business decision-making. It
   assesses its short-, medium- and long-term effects, considering the
   interaction between GAI and human judgment. Challenges related to
   uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity are examined, and the relevant
   literature is reviewed to understand these aspects comprehensively.
   Results: The review shows that, despite the advanced capabilities of GAI
   to analyze data and generate patterns, human judgment remains crucial in
   situations of high uncertainty. The results suggest that combining GAI
   with human expertise can improve the accuracy and efficiency of
   strategic decision-making by integrating the strengths of both parties.
   Conclusions: The implementation of GAI can offer significant
   improvements in the efficiency and accuracy of business decisions.
   However, human judgment and experience remain essential, especially in
   uncertain contexts. The key to maximizing the benefits of GAI lies in
   finding the right balance between artificial intelligence and human
   capital.},

Title = {GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN PSYCHOLOGY: IMPLICATIONS AND
   RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SCIENCE AND PRACTICE},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {103},
Number = {5},
Pages = {188-206},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly
   prevalent across various fields, particularly in psychology, where it
   has the potential to significantly transform approaches to diagnosis,
   therapy, and research. This paper summarizes current research on the use
   of generative AI in psychology and its impact on the theory and practice
   of psychological science. One of the primary applications of generative
   AI is in psychodiagnostics, where it can be used to automate the
   creation of diagnostic tools and interpret test results, analyze large
   volumes of data, and provide more accurate diagnostic conclusions. This
   significantly reduces the workload on psychologists while simultaneously
   increasing the efficiency of diagnostic processes. In the field of
   psychotherapy, generative AI can be used to create individualized
   therapeutic programs that provide continuous support to users, which is
   particularly important when access to qualified specialists is limited.
   Another important aspect is the use of generative AI in psychological
   research: AI can help in creating behavior models, predicting mental
   disorders, developing new research methodologies, reducing routine
   administrative burdens, and more. While generative AI revolutionizes the
   work of psychologists, it simultaneously creates complex issues related
   to ethics, confidentiality, accuracy of diagnostic and therapeutic
   methods, and more. To ensure that generative AI is effective and
   ethical, clear standards and regulatory frameworks must be developed for
   its use. Therefore, the authors propose recommendations for the
   implementation of AI in psychological practice, emphasizing the need to
   develop specific guidelines to address these issues. The role of
   psychologists in ensuring the ethical use of AI, the necessity of
   continuous monitoring, and the assessment of its impact on users are
   also discussed. Overall, generative AI holds great potential for
   psychological research and practice, but its implementation requires
   careful planning and consideration of ethical aspects to ensure safety
   and effectiveness.},

   we collected a database of 616,073 tweets about ChatGPT, and used
   Natural Language Processing techniques to identify the tasks users
   requested ChatGPT to perform, and the sentiment related to these tasks.
   Then, we compared these tasks with a standard taxonomy of skills (i.e.,
   ESCO) using BERT. The results of the study underline that ChatGPT
   impacts 185 different skills. Moreover, we proposed a model to represent
   the interaction of the user and ChatGPT, useful to define four skills

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping consumer
   interactions by offering personalized guidance that ranges from broad
   suggestions to narrow recommendations. Yet, little is known about how
   these interactions influence decision-making and consumer empowerment.
   This research investigates how distinct types of GenAI nudges (narrow
   vs. broad) shape goal desirability and, in turn, consumer empowerment.
   Drawing upon Construal Level Theory (CLT), Goal Pursuit Theory, and
   Nudging Theory, we examine whether narrow (vs. broad) GenAI nudges
   enhance consumers' sense of empowerment by increasing goal desirability.
   Three mixed-method studies (one qualitative and two experimental) reveal
   that narrow GenAI nudges significantly heighten goal desirability,
   leading to greater consumer empowerment and key behavioral outcomes,
   including satisfaction, repurchase intentions, and advocacy (net
   promoter score). These findings advance theoretical perspectives on
   GenAI as a nudge for consumer decision-making and offer practical
   insights for designing AI systems that effectively guide consumer
   decisions within structured choice architectures.},

Abstract = {Background Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools may soon be
   integrated into health care practice and research. Nurses in leadership
   roles, many of whom are doctorally prepared, will need to determine
   whether and how to integrate them in a safe and useful way. Objective
   This study aimed to develop and evaluate a brief intervention to
   increase PhD nursing students' knowledge of appropriate applications for
   using generative AI tools in health care. Methods We created didactic
   lectures and laboratory-based activities to introduce generative AI to
   students enrolled in a nursing PhD data science and visualization
   course. Students were provided with a subscription to Chat Generative
   Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) 4.0, a general-purpose generative AI
   tool, for use in and outside the class. During the didactic portion, we
   described generative AI and its current and potential future
   applications in health care, including examples of appropriate and
   inappropriate applications. In the laboratory sessions, students were
   given three tasks representing different use cases of generative AI in
   health care practice and research (clinical decision support, patient
   decision support, and scientific communication) and asked to engage with
   ChatGPT on each. Students ( n = 10) independently wrote a brief
   reflection for each task evaluating safety (accuracy, hallucinations)
   and usability (ease of use, usefulness, and intention to use in the
   future). Reflections were analyzed using directed content analysis.
   Results Students were able to identify the strengths and limitations of
   ChatGPT in completing all three tasks and developed opinions on whether
   they would feel comfortable using ChatGPT for similar tasks in the
   future. All of them reported increasing their self-rated competency in
   generative AI by one to two points on a five-point rating scale.
   Conclusion This brief educational intervention supported doctoral
   nursing students in understanding the appropriate uses of ChatGPT, which
   may support their ability to appraise and use these tools in their
   future work.},

   traditional theoretical instruction. This study explores the application
   of Smart Action Learning (SAL) and generative AI tools in the
   ``Functional Clothing and Materials{''} course to enhance student
   engagement, problem-solving abilities, and practical skill acquisition.
   SAL, a student-centered learning approach, incorporates blended
   learning, flipped learning, and problem-based learning (PBL)
   methodologies to foster self-directed and cooperative learning. The
   study was conducted over an eight-week period with second-year students
   in an apparel major, integrating AI-based problem-solving techniques
   into coursework. The course design included a five-stage instructional
   framework: instructor-led lectures, problem identification, AI-assisted
   research, collaborative solution development, and final presentations.
   The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated through surveys
   measuring self-directed learning ability, cooperative learning ability,
   problem-solving ability, and academic achievement. Results indicate that
   students demonstrated high levels of engagement, improved
   problem-solving abilities, and increased learning satisfaction through
   AI-assisted collaborative projects. The findings suggest that
   incorporating generative AI into fashion education enhances creative
   thinking, industry readiness, and adaptability to emerging trends.},

Abstract = {Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in chemistry, more
   or less covertly, for many decades (databases for data management,
   programs for designing synthesis, toxicological expert systems, etc.),
   the massive emergence of user-friendly artificial intelligence presents
   an interesting opportunity and challenge for chemists to improve the
   communication power of chemistry and its position in society. Although
   repeatedly questioned by many critics per se value-neutral generative AI
   stands a good chance of becoming an important tool for presenting
   chemical information throughout all strata of society. Additionally, it
   can support the spread of science-based opinions on chemistry to the
   public and help popularize science in general as well. AI allows
   virtually every scientist to become a major player in science
   communication. This could lead to a containment of chemophobia. However,
   the use of AI as a communication tool requires continuous education,
   personal development and training of those who use it, in this case
   chemists and scientists in general. They will play a crucial role as
   arbiters of the appropriateness, adequacy and factual accuracy of the
   content generated by generative AI. The democratization of communication
   made possible by generative AI entails the need to adapt the dialogue to
   the communication preferences, demography and education of the
   interlocutors. Thus, generative AI empowers both those who enter the
   prompts and those who receive the subsequent results. Most scientists do
   not realize it, but generative AI puts the public, not scientists, at
   the center of communication. It is important to recognize this and use
   generative AI to target communication, education, and overall community
   development. The clash of narratives that may be a natural consequence
   of the growing number of generative AI users and the increasing amount
   of content being created may, perhaps unexpectedly for many, lead to the
   opposite result - a new Enlightenment. Either way, chemists would do
   well to be there; for their ability to understand the laws of matter,
   the beginning and end of things; for the dual nature of chemistry as an
   art and a science.},

   that although data mining has considerable potential for AI development
   and its integration into the EU legislative framework is crucial, both
   the structure of the exception and the diversity of national approaches
   do not provide a regulatory framework that allows for its harmonized
   application across the EU, and this could undermine its use in the GenAI

Abstract = {Digital wellbeing has been the subject of extensive research in
   educational contexts. Yet, there remains a paucity of studies conducted
   within the paradigm of generative AI, a field with the potential to
   significantly influence students' sentiments and dispositions in this
   domain. This study analyses 474 student recommendations (information
   science and library science) for digital wellbeing in generative
   artificial intelligence. The research is based on the context of
   pragmatism, which rejects the differentiation between thinking and
   acting and ties both phenomena into one interpretive whole. The research
   method is thematic analysis; students proposed rules for digital
   wellbeing in the context of generative AI, which was followed by the
   established theory. The study has identified four specific areas that
   need to be the focus of research attention: societal expectations of the
   positive benefits of using generative AI, particular ways of interacting
   with generative AI, its risks, and students' adaptive strategies.
   Research has shown that risks in this context must be considered part of
   the elements that make up the environment in which students seek to
   achieve balance through adaptive strategies. The key adaptive elements
   included the ability to think critically and creatively, autonomy, care
   for others, take responsibility, and the reflected ontological
   difference between humans and machines.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {1279-1289},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a noteworthy
   milestone and a consequential advancement in the annals of major
   disciplines within the domains of human science and technology. This
   study aims to explore the effects of generative AI-assisted preservice
   teaching skills training on preservice teachers' self-efficacy and
   higher order thinking. The participants of this study were 215
   preservice mathematics, science, and computer teachers from a university
   in China. First, a pretest-post-test quasi-experimental design was
   implemented for an experimental group (teaching skills training by
   generative AI) and a control group (teaching skills training by
   traditional methods) by investigating the teacher self-efficacy and
   higher order thinking of the two groups before and after the experiment.
   Finally, a semistructured interview comprising open-ended questions was
   administered to 25 preservice teachers within the experimental group to
   present their views on generative AI-assisted teaching. The results
   showed that the scores of preservice teachers in the experimental group,
   who used generative AI for teachers' professional development, were
   considerably higher than those of the control group, both in teacher
   self-efficacy (F = 8.589, p = 0.0084 < 0.05) and higher order thinking
   (F = 7.217, p = 0.008 < 0.05). It revealed that generative AI can be
   effective in supporting teachers' professional development. This study
   produced a practical teachers' professional development method for
   preservice teachers with generative AI.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for both text-to-text
   and text-to-image applications have seen rapid and widespread adoption
   in the general and medical communities. While limitations of generative
   AI have been widely reported, there remain valuable applications in
   patient and professional communities. Here, the limitations and biases
   of both text-to-text and text-to-image generative AI are explored using
   purported applications in medical imaging as case examples. A direct
   comparison of the capabilities of four common text-to-image generative
   AI algorithms is reported and recommendations for the most appropriate
   use, DALL-E 3, justified. The risks use and biases are outlined, and
   appropriate use guidelines framed for use of generative AI in nuclear
   medicine. Generative AI text-to-text and text-to-image generation
   includes inherent biases, particularly gender and ethnicity, that could
   misrepresent nuclear medicine. The assimilation of generative AI tools
   into medical education, image interpretation, patient education, health

Volume = {12},
Abstract = {The increasing interest in the potential applications of generative
   artificial intelligence (AI) models like ChatGPT in health care has
   prompted numerous studies to explore its performance in various medical
   contexts. However, evaluating ChatGPT poses unique challenges due to the
   inherent randomness in its responses. Unlike traditional AI models,
   ChatGPT generates different responses for the same input, making it
   imperative to assess its stability through repetition. This commentary
   highlights the importance of including repetition in the evaluation of
   ChatGPT to ensure the reliability of conclusions drawn from its
   performance. Similar to biological experiments, which often require
   multiple repetitions for validity, we argue that assessing generative AI
   models like ChatGPT demands a similar approach. Failure to acknowledge
   the impact of repetition can lead to biased conclusions and undermine
   the credibility of research findings. We urge researchers to incorporate
   appropriate repetition in their studies from the outset and
   transparently report their methods to enhance the robustness and
   reproducibility of findings in this rapidly evolving field.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper, we undertake a critical analysis of how chatbots built on
   generative artificial intelligence impact assumptions underlying
   definitions of trust. We engage a particular definition of trust and the
   object-oriented model of trust that was built upon it and identify how
   at least four implicit assumptions may no longer hold. Those assumptions
   include that people generally provide others with a default level of
   trust, the ability to identify whether the trusted agent is human or
   artificial, that risk and trust can be readily quantified or
   categorized, and that there is no expectation of gain by agents engaged
   in trust relationships. Based on that analysis, we suggest modifications
   to the definition and model to accommodate the features of generative AI
   chatbots. Our changes re-emphasize developers' responsibility for the
   impacts of their AI artifacts, no matter how sophisticated the artifact
   may be. The changes also reflect that trust relationships are more
   fraught when participants in such relationships are not confident in
   identifying the nature of a potential trust partner.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is undergoing a pivotal
   transformation, evolving from discriminative models that classify data
   to generative AI systems capable of creating novel content. Generative
   AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can learn from and mimic
   large amounts of data to create content such as text, images, music,
   videos, code, and more. The generative AI paradigm relies on advanced
   architectures, including large language models (LLMs), which are likely
   to redefine key processes in the practice of clinical medicine. The
   imaging- and procedure-heavy specialty of orthopaedic surgery is
   uniquely positioned to benefit from innovations in spatial reasoning,
   biomechanical analysis, and procedural planning using generative AI. Key
   applications are rapidly emerging, like streamlining clinical workflows
   through automated documentation, the mediation of patient-provider
   communication and enhanced interpretability of complex medical
   information. While an exciting field the current evidence base is quite
   limited. The continued integration of these technologies promises to
   enhance surgical precision, democratise access to advanced planning, and
   ultimately improve patient outcomes. However, realising this potential
   requires overcoming significant challenges related to the `black box'
   nature of models, data bias, and evolving regulatory oversight. Rigorous
   clinical validation through prospective trials will be essential to
   ensure the safe, effective, and equitable implementation of generative
   AI in the future of orthopaedic care.Level of Evidence Level V.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT are rapidly
   expanding in scientific research and publication due to their excellent
   language understanding, generation and knowledge reasoning capabilities,
   but the accompanying ethical issues of publication cannot be ignored.
   User agreements can provide behavioural guidance for users to use
   generative AI tools, but its ethical guiding role in academic publishing
   is unclear. This study aims to investigate the ethical implications of
   generative AI in academic publishing, with a specific focus on the role
   of user agreements. We selected 98 large language models (LLMs) which
   were divided into 23 series, and analysed their user agreements and
   privacy policy content to explore their ethical guiding role in academic
   publishing. The survey study found that LLMs user agreements had
   relevant provisions on intellectual property, data privacy and security,
   quality and integrity, and so on, but there were still controversial and
   needed to be further improved contents, such as the ownership of LLMs
   output, and continuous supervision and update of user agreements. The
   publishing community should collaborate closely with academics,
   technical developers, and legal experts to promote the formation of an
   ethical framework for the application of generative AI technology in
   academic publishing. This study systematically analyses the guidance of
   user agreements for LLMs in academic publishing ethics, filling a gap in
   the literature on ethical norms in the field of academic publishing for

Abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology,
   generative AI has shown broad application prospects and potential in
   various fields. Frequent emergencies have put forward higher
   requirements for traditional Emergency Response Decision Support Systems
   (ERDSS). This paper proposes a theoretical framework of ERDSS based on
   generative AI (ERDSS-GAI), which deeply integrates generative AI with
   three stages of emergency response decision-making. The framework aims
   to leverage the advantages of generative AI in massive data processing,
   knowledge mining, strategy optimization, and other aspects, thereby
   enhancing the intelligence level and emergency response capability of
   ERDSS. The key components and implementation path of ERDSS-GAI are
   systematically explained from a theoretical perspective, and its
   application value is analyzed through the case of rainstorm and flood
   disaster in Shenzhen. This research demonstrates that generative AI can
   improve the scientific and refined level of emergency response
   decision-making, providing a theoretical framework and practical
   insights for its widespread adoption in emergency management.},

Abstract = {Generative modeling is an artificial intelligence (AI) technique to
   generate synthetic artifacts from analyzing training examples and from
   learning their patterns and distribution. Generative AI (GenAI) uses
   generative modeling and advances in Deep Learning to produce diverse

   is mostly using media contents, such as text, graphics, audio, and
   video, it can additionally be used also for data from the (Industrial)
   Internet of Things. This article provides a systematic overview on the
   manifold different practical opportunities and challenges GenAI brings
   for the IIoT. It also presents selected examples from the author's

Title = {Medical students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward generative
   artificial intelligence in Egypt 2024: a Cross-Sectional study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Background Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) has
   revolutionized the healthcare system for medical students and their
   educational process worldwide. Several studies assessed its efficacy in
   improving medical studies learning, and others assessed medical
   students' knowledge and attitudes about generative AI. So, we aim to
   determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of generative AI among
   medical students in Egypt. Methods In 2024, a cross-sectional study
   using a semi-structured questionnaire was performed, targeting 423
   students as a convenient sample from 10 selected Egyptian universities
   by simple random sampling. The questionnaire was distributed via online
   platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, X, Telegram, and Messenger. Data
   about sociodemographic characteristics, students' general knowledge
   about generative AI and its limitations, and their attitudes and
   practices, respectively, were collected. Results About
   2\textbackslash{}3 (61.5\%) of the studied students had satisfactory
   knowledge about generative AI and (44.7\%) had a positive attitude.
   Males demonstrated significantly higher knowledge than females (69.3\%
   vs. 55\%, P-value = 0.003). Knowledge level also differs significantly
   by university (P-value < 0.001), with Suez-Canal and 6th October
   university students achieving the highest satisfactory scores. Key
   significant predictors that affect knowledge level include gender,
   university and study phase according to binary logistic regression
   results. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between
   satisfactory knowledge and Practice level (r = 0.303, P < 0.001).
   Finally, most students use generative AI to check Grammar and prepare
   their homework or assignments. Conclusion and recommendations There is
   moderate knowledge and positive attitude about AI that were reflected in
   medical students' practice. However, knowledge about AI influenced by
   gender, university and study phase. Importantly, better knowledge
   significantly correlates with greater generative AI practice. Offering
   specialized courses or faculty modules about AI enhance awareness among
   Egyptian medical students. Such initiatives will enable them to gain
   knowledge and apply it effectively and wisely.},

   Secondary School Programming Education},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 4},
Abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence in education, particularly in
   learning programming, is gaining increasing significance. However,
   research on secondary school students specializing in IT at an early
   stage has received relatively little attention in this field. The aim of
   this study is to assess how vocational secondary school IT students
   utilize Generative artificial intelligence in learning programming. The
   study employed a survey-based methodology, where students with varying
   levels of knowledge were surveyed to understand their AI usage patterns.
   The sample consisted of students from vocational IT schools, and data
   were analyzed using descriptive statistics and independent samples
   t-tests. The results indicate that students with different levels of
   knowledge use AI tools differently, with ChatGPT being the most popular
   tool. The study further highlights that AI usage brings significant
   benefits, such as providing a personalized learning experience and
   enabling quick error correction. However, excessive reliance on AI tools
   may hinder students from acquiring fundamental programming skills. The
   findings support the idea that while AI can effectively complement
   teachers' explanations, overdependence on it can be risky, potentially
   reducing students' creativity and problem-solving abilities. The study
   emphasizes the crucial role of educators in teaching the responsible and
   ethical use of artificial intelligence. The results of this research
   offer new perspectives on the effective integration of Generative
   artificial intelligence into vocational secondary school programming
   education and suggest further studies to compare its applications at the
   university level. However, the study acknowledges certain limitations,
   such as the potential bias of self-reported data, which may affect the
   generalizability of the results. Unlike other studies, the age groups we
   surveyed, and the cohorts formed from them are nearly evenly
   distributed, making our sample representative of the region in question.},

Journal = {BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING},

Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {New developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are
   increasingly finding their way into industrial areas such as additive
   manufacturing (AM). Generative AI (GAI) applications in particular offer
   interesting possibilities here, for example, to generate texts, images
   or computer codes with the help of algorithms and to integrate these as
   useful supports in various AM processes. This paper examines the
   opportunities that GAI offers specifically for additive manufacturing.
   There are currently relatively few publications that deal with the topic
   of GAI in AM. Much of the information has only been published in
   preprints. There, the focus has been on algorithms for Natural Language
   Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative
   adversarial networks (GANs). This summarised presentation of the state
   of the art of GAI in AM is new and the link to specific use cases is
   this first comprehensive case study on GAI in AM processes. Building on
   this, three specific use cases are then developed in which generative AI
   tools are used to optimise AM processes. Finally, a Strengths,
   Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis is carried out on
   the general possibilities of GAI, which forms the basis for an in-depth
   discussion on the sensible use of GAI tools in AM. The key findings of
   this work are that GAI can be integrated into AM processes as a useful
   support, making these processes faster and more creative, as well as to
   make the process information digitally recordable and usable. This
   current and future potential, as well as the technical implementation of
   GAI into AM, is also presented and explained visually. It is also shown
   where the use of generative AI tools can be useful and where current or
   future potential risks may arise.},

   issue explores the management and integration of GenAI in educational
   settings, including the ethical considerations, best practices, and
   opportunities. The potential of GenAI in education is vast. By using
   algorithms and data, GenAI can create original content that can be used
   to augment traditional teaching methods, creating a more interactive and
   personalized learning experience. In addition, GenAI can be utilized as
   an assessment tool and for providing feedback to students using
   generated content. For instance, it can be used to create custom
   quizzes, generate essay prompts, or even grade essays. The use of GenAI
   as an assessment tool can reduce the workload of teachers and help
   students receive prompt feedback on their work. Incorporating GenAI in
   educational settings also poses challenges related to academic
   integrity. With availability of GenAI models, students can use them to
   study or complete their homework assignments, which can raise concerns
   about the authenticity and authorship of the delivered work. Therefore,
   it is important to ensure that academic standards are maintained, and
   the originality of the student's work is preserved. This issue

Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is reshaping how people interact with
   digital technologies, emphasizing the need to develop effective skills
   for engaging with it. In this context, prompt engineering has emerged as
   a critical skill for optimizing AI-generated outputs. However, research
   on how higher education students interact with these technologies
   remains limited, particularly in non-English-speaking contexts. This
   exploratory study examines how 102 higher education students in Chile
   formulated prompts in Spanish and how their techniques influenced the
   responses generated by ChatGPT (free version 3.5). A quantitative
   analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between prompt
   techniques and response quality. Two emergent prompt engineering
   strategies were identified: the Guide Contextualization Strategy and the
   Specific Purpose Strategy. The Guide Contextualization Strategy focused
   on providing explicit contextual information to guide ChatGPT's
   responses, aligning with few-shot prompting, while the Specific Purpose
   Strategy emphasized defining the request's purpose, aligning with
   structured objective formulation strategies. The regression analysis
   indicated that the Guide Contextualization Strategy had a greater impact
   on response quality, reinforcing the importance of contextual
   information in effective interactions with large language models. As an
   exploratory study, these findings provide preliminary evidence on prompt
   engineering strategies in Spanish, a relatively unexplored area in
   artificial intelligence education research. Based on these results, a
   methodological framework is proposed, encompassing four key dimensions:
   grammatical skills; prompt strategies; response from the large language
   model; and evaluation of response quality. This framework lays the
   groundwork for future artificial intelligence digital literacy
   interventions, fostering critical and effective engagement with
   generative artificial intelligence while also highlighting the need for
   further research to validate and expand these initial insights.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be broadly described as an
   artificial intelligence system capable of generating images, text, and
   other media types with human prompts. GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E,
   and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia
   equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming,
   fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical
   research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making
   strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed
   study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare.
   Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications,
   real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine
   how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the
   applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient
   treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization,
   mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical
   chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along

   methodology to systematically identify risks associated with generative
   AI. By considering both the frequency of risk occurrence and the
   severity of potential losses, the study uses triangular fuzzy numbers to
   quantify potential risks at various stages. Finally, by comparing the
   quantitative risk assessment outcomes, this paper explores comprehensive
   risk governance strategies for generative AI.FindingsA staged risk
   identification system for generative AI has been established, enabling
   effective quantification of risks. Additionally, tailored risk
   governance strategies have been provided for different stages of
   generative AI development.Originality/valueThis paper refines and
   enhances the risk identification system for generative AI, elucidates
   key risk governance points at various stages of AI development and is
   crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of generative AI
   throughout its entire service lifecycle.},

Abstract = {The phrase, ``political theology,{''} has been understood in at least
   three ways: to describe the political implications of various
   theologies, to describe a theology of politics, and to describe the
   theological language that funds modern secular political systems. This
   paper explores the way generative artificial intelligence intersects
   with each of those understandings, especially noting the impact of AI on
   actual physical and corporate bodies. It argues for closer attention to
   the moral concerns that are raised within each understanding and
   advocates for design justice as a way to push the development of AI
   towards supporting systems that promote the flourishing of individual
   and corporate bodies.},

Abstract = {The discovery of new drugs has important implications for human health.
   Traditional methods for drug discovery rely on experiments to optimize
   the structure of lead molecules, which are time-consuming and high-cost.
   Recently, artificial intelligence has exhibited promising and efficient
   performance for drug-like molecule generation. In particular, deep
   generative models achieve great success in de novo generation of
   drug-like molecules with desired properties, showing massive potential
   for novel drug discovery. In this study, we review the recent progress
   of molecule generation using deep generative models, mainly focusing on
   molecule representations, public databases, data processing tools, and
   advanced artificial intelligence based molecule generation frameworks.
   In particular, we present a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art
   deep generative models for molecule generation and a summary of commonly
   used molecular design strategies. We identify research gaps and
   challenges of molecule generation such as the need for better databases,
   missing 3D information in molecular representation, and the lack of
   high-precision evaluation metrics. We suggest future directions for
   molecular generation and drug discovery.},

   Experiential Learning for Authentic Assessment},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) requires
   innovative educational environments to leverage this technology
   effectively to address concerns like academic integrity, plagiarism, and
   others. Additionally, higher education needs effective pedagogies to
   achieve intended learning outcomes. This emphasizes the need to redesign
   active learning experiences in the GenAI era. Authentic assessment and
   experiential learning are two possible meaningful alternatives in this
   context. Accordingly, this article investigates how GenAI can enhance
   teaching and learning by constructively addressing study situations
   beyond conventional learning approaches and cultivating high-order
   skills and knowledge acquisition. This study employs thing ethnography
   to examine GenAI tools' integration with authentic assessment and
   experiential learning and explore implementation alternatives. The
   results reveal insights into creating human-centered and GenAI-enhanced
   learning experiences within a constructive alignment. Specific examples
   are also provided to guide their implementation. Our contributions
   extend beyond the traditional use of GenAI tools as mere agents-to-write
   or agents-to-answer questions to become agents-to-support experiential
   learning for authentic assessment. These findings underscore the
   transformative role of GenAI tools in enhancing teaching and learning
   efficacy and effectiveness. The limitations in treating GenAI tools as
   subjects in thing ethnography are acknowledged, with potential for
   future implementation evaluation.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been part of every citizen's life for
   several years. Still, the emergence of generative AI (GenAI), accessible
   to all, has raised discussions about the ethical issues they raise,
   particularly in education. GenAI tools generate content according to
   user requests, but are students using these tools ethically and safely?
   Can teachers guide students in this use and use these tools in their
   teaching activities? This paper argues that teacher professional
   development (TPD) is an essential key trigger in adopting these emerging
   technologies. The paper will present an integrative literature review
   that discusses the components of TPD that may empower teachers to guide
   their students towards the ethical and safe use of GenAI. According to
   the literature review, one key component of TPD should be AI literacy,
   which involves understanding AI, its capabilities and limitations, and
   its potential benefits and drawbacks in education. Another essential
   component is hands-on activities that engage teachers, their peers, and
   students in actively using these tools during the training process. The
   paper will discuss the advantages of working with GenAI tools and
   designing lesson plans to implement them critically in the classroom.},

Abstract = {This study presents an in-depth examination of the role of Generative
   Artificial Intelligence in enhancing entrepreneurial success, situated
   within the educational context of a leading business school in Peru.
   Utilizing the Technology-to-Performance Chain framework, the research
   integrates both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to explore
   the alignment and impact of Generative AI on entrepreneurial tasks.
   Through a multi-case study approach involving 78 early-stage
   entrepreneurs, the study delves into how Generative AI tools influence
   individual performance outcomes in entrepreneurial endeavors. The
   qualitative findings reveal a consensus among entrepreneurs about the
   positive influence of Generative AI on task performance, highlighting
   aspects such as Work Compatibility, Ease of Use, and Information
   Quality. Complementing this, the quantitative analysis quantifies the
   relationships between these dimensions of Generative AI use and outcomes
   like tool utilization and performance impact, corroborating and
   enriching the qualitative insights. The study discovers that Work
   Compatibility is a significant predictor of Generative AI tool
   utilization, indicating that when entrepreneurs perceive a strong
   alignment between their tasks and the AI tools' capabilities, they are
   more likely to use these tools extensively. Furthermore, the research
   elucidates the positive correlations between tool Utilization and
   Performance Impact, underlining the importance of user-friendly
   technology and high-quality information output in entrepreneurial
   ventures. This study contributes significantly to the literature on
   entrepreneurship and Generative AI, offering valuable insights for
   educators, policymakers, and entrepreneurs. It emphasizes the need for
   aligning technology with tasks for enhancing performance, laying the
   groundwork for integrating advanced technologies into entrepreneurship
   education and practice. The findings highlight the immense potential of
   Generative AI in shaping the future of entrepreneurship, advocating for
   its strategic inclusion in educational curricula and entrepreneurial
   ventures.},

   Juxtaposing two empirical use cases-autonomous vehicles and virtual

   studies seem to be at odds with each other, they illustrate the
   mechanisms of new profit models built on rent extraction. Consequently,
   far from ushering a Matrix-style simulation that cannot be theorized,
   hyperproduction remains not only grounded in, but also bounded by,

Abstract = {As the next-generation wireless communication system, sixth-generation
   (6G) technologies are emerging, enabling various mobile edge networks
   that can revolutionize wireless communication and connectivity. By
   integrating generative artificial intelligence (GAI) with mobile edge
   networks, generative mobile edge networks possess immense potential to
   enhance the intelligence and efficiency of wireless communication
   networks. In this article, we propose the concept of generative mobile
   edge networks and overview widely adopted GAI technologies and their
   applications in mobile edge networks. We then discuss the potential
   challenges faced by generative mobile edge networks in
   resource-constrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we develop
   a universal resource-efficient generative incentive mechanism framework,
   in which we design resource-efficient methods for network overhead
   reduction, formulate appropriate incentive mechanisms for the resource
   allocation problem, and utilize generative diffusion models (GDMs) to
   find the optimal incentive mechanism solutions. Furthermore, we conduct
   a case study on resource-constrained mobile edge networks, employing
   model partitioning for efficient AI task offloading, and proposing a
   GDM-based Stackelberg model to motivate edge devices to contribute
   computing resources for mobile edge intelligence. Finally, we propose
   several open directions that could contribute to the future popularity
   of generative mobile edge networks.},

Abstract = {Substantial research over the last ten years has indicated that many
   generative artificial intelligence systems ({''}GAI{''}) have the
   potential to produce biased results, particularly with respect to
   gender. This potential for bias has grown progressively more important
   in recent years as GAI has become increasingly integrated in multiple
   critical sectors, such as healthcare, consumer lending, and employment.
   While much of the study of gender bias in popular GAI systems is focused
   on text-based GAI such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini (formerly
   Bard), this article describes the results of a confirmatory experiment
   of gender bias in visual GAI systems. The authors argue that the
   potential for gender bias in visual GAI systems is potentially more
   troubling than bias in textual GAI because of the superior memorability
   of images and the capacity for emotional communication that images
   represent. They go on to offer four potential approaches to gender bias
   in visual GAI based on the roles visual GAI could play in modern
   society. The article concludes with a discussion of how dominant
   societal values could influence a choice between those four potential
   approaches to gender bias in visual GAI and some suggestions for further

Abstract = {Recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI) in retinal imaging found
   its application in two major categories: discriminative and generative
   AI. For discriminative tasks, conventional convolutional neural networks
   (CNNs) are still major AI techniques. Vision transformers (ViT),
   inspired by the transformer architecture in natural language processing,
   has emerged as useful techniques for discriminating retinal images. ViT
   can attain excellent results when pretrained at sufficient scale and
   transferred to specific tasks with fewer images, compared to
   conventional CNN. Many studies found better performance of ViT, compared
   to CNN, for common tasks such as diabetic retinopathy screening on color
   fundus photographs (CFP) and segmentation of retinal fluid on optical
   coherence tomography (OCT) images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
   is the main AI technique in generative AI in retinal imaging. Novel
   images generated by GAN can be applied for training AI models in
   imbalanced or inadequate datasets. Foundation models are also recent
   advances in retinal imaging. They are pretrained with huge datasets,
   such as millions of CFP and OCT images and fine-tuned for downstream
   tasks with much smaller datasets. A foundation model, RETFound, which
   was self-supervised and found to discriminate many eye and systemic
   diseases better than supervised models. Large language models are
   foundation models that may be applied for text-related tasks, like
   reports of retinal angiography. Whereas AI technology moves forward
   fast, real-world use of AI models moves slowly, making the gap between
   development and deployment even wider. Strong evidence showing AI models
   can prevent visual loss may be required to close this gap.},

   core element ``scholarship, research and inquiry{''} were lacking at the
   micro and meso levels; likewise, recommendations for the core element
   ``learning spaces, pedagogies, and technologies{''} were also absent at
   the meso, macro, and mega levels. We acknowledge that these
   recommendations focus on learning, involve various stakeholders, and go
   beyond student conduct, which aligns with current approaches to academic
   integrity. However, some gaps need further exploration. We highlight the
   need to develop more specific and practical guidance and resources for
   educational stakeholders around GenAI issues related to academic
   integrity, explore how to better support networks and leaders in higher
   education in creating the conditions for ethical GenAI use, and
   emphasizing the need for an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion lens on
   GenAI.},

Abstract = {The current study explores continuous intention (CI) to use generative
   artificial intelligence (GenAI) as an educational tool among university
   students through the prism of a post-pandemic theoretical framework.
   Despite GenAI technology's latest launch in the academia sector, very
   little has been done to evaluate its effects. To examine what factors
   impact the continuous intention to use GenAI, this paper contemplates
   incorporating the technology acceptance model with self-determination
   theory. University students were requested to fill out questionnaire
   forms that were designed to gather data for the proposed model. A hybrid
   approach combining a linear partial least squares structural equation
   modeling model with compensation and a non-linear artificial neural
   network (ANN) model without compensation is used to investigate the
   effect of CI on the use of GenAI as an educational tool. The empirical
   results indicated that perceived usefulness and autonomy are significant
   predictors of the continued intention to use GenAI in the Thai context.
   However, the CI was unaffected by perceived ease of use. Additionally,
   the ANN model indicates that relatedness is the most important
   predictor. Overall, theoretical and practical ramifications are
   addressed.},

Abstract = {Our world is becoming rapidly dependent on data of increasing

   tools to process such big data. Probabilistic generative models fulfill
   this goal by learning latent characteristic data relations, especially
   for the recent emergence of large-scale deep generative models that are
   able to create realistic content, namely, artificial
   intelligence-generated content (AIGC). The applications of AIGC span
   across various domains, and witness rich potential in multimedia content
   creation, including dialog generation, text-to-speech conversion,
   image/video generation, and cross-modal content generation.},

Title = {Effects of Generative Chatbots in Higher Education},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Learning technologies often do not meet the university requirements for
   learner engagement via interactivity and real-time feedback. In addition
   to the challenge of providing personalized learning experiences for
   students, these technologies can increase the workload of instructors
   due to the maintenance and updates required to keep the courses
   up-to-date. Intelligent chatbots based on generative artificial
   intelligence (AI) technology can help overcome these disadvantages by
   transforming pedagogical activities and guiding both students and
   instructors interactively. In this study, we explore and compare the
   main characteristics of existing educational chatbots. Then, we propose
   a new theoretical framework for blended learning with intelligent
   chatbots integration enabling students to interact online and
   instructors to create and manage their courses using generative AI
   tools. The advantages of the proposed framework are as follows: (1) it
   provides a comprehensive understanding of the transformative potential
   of AI chatbots in education and facilitates their effective
   implementation; (2) it offers a holistic methodology to enhance the
   overall educational experience; and (3) it unifies the applications of
   intelligent chatbots in teaching-learning activities within
   universities.},

Abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has
   significantly transformed learning patterns and innovative approaches.
   Human-machine (generative artificial intelligence) co-creation will
   become the norm, necessitating that learners possess the requisite AI
   literacy (AIL) to adapt to this shift. The mechanisms by which
   individual AIL influences innovative behavior (IB) in human-machine
   collaborative environments remain unclear. Therefore, this study,
   grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), employs a snowball
   sampling method to survey 460 university students, utilizing structural
   equation modeling to analyze the relationships among their AI literacy
   (AIL), psychological need satisfaction (PNS), creative self-efficacy
   (CSE), self-regulated learning (SRL), and innovative behavior (IB). The
   results indicate that AIL does not directly influence learners' IB. PNS,
   CSE, and SRL serve as mediators between AIL and IB. Furthermore, AIL
   influences learners' PNS and CSE in innovative activities, which in turn
   affects their use of SRL to adjust their innovation processes, thereby
   promoting the application of GAI in generating IB.},
