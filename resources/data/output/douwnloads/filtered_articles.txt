In this conceptual paper, we describe the intersection between evaluative judgement and generative AI with a view to articulating how assessment practices can help students learn to work productively with generative AI. We propose three foci: (1) developing evaluative judgement of generative AI outputs; (2) developing evaluative judgement of generative AI processes; and (3) generative AI assessment of student evaluative judgements. We argue for developing students' capabilities to identify and calibrate quality of work - uniquely human capabilities at a time of technological acceleration - through existing formative assessment strategies. These approaches circumvent and interrupt students' uncritical usage of generative AI. The relationship between evaluative judgement and generative AI is more than just the application of human judgement to machine outputs.

Here these two types of generative intelligence, artificial in machines and real in the human brain are compared, and it is shown how when whole memories are generated by hippocampal recall in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, what the human brain computes, and how it computes it, are very different from generative AI. Key differences are the use of local associative learning rules in the hippocampal memory system, and of non-local backpropagation of error learning in AI. Indeed, it is argued that the whole operation of the human brain is performed computationally very differently to what is implemented in generative AI. Moreover, it is emphasized that the primate including human hippocampal system includes computations about spatial view and where objects and people are in scenes, whereas in rodents the emphasis is on place cells and path integration by movements between places.

Furthermore, the generated ratios are utilized to discover current patterns with minimized losses and errors, hence enhancing the accuracy of generative contents. Furthermore, while analysing the created patterns, we detect a significant discrepancy in lead durations, resulting in the generation of high scores for relevant information. In order to test the results using generative tools, the adversarial network codes are employed in four scenarios.

The principle of transparency not only requires the operational principles and algorithms of text-based generative artificial intelligence to be interpretable, but also requires text-based generative artificial intelligence programs to fulfill basic prompting obligations to users, especially when it comes to the output content of generative artificial intelligence, which cannot guarantee true and accurate prompts.AimsThe purpose of this study is to explore the classification and frequency of prompt methods in text-based generative artificial intelligence and to propose that laws should require different prompt rules for various user categories, addressing the current gap in existing regulations.MethodsThe experiment is conducted from June 1 to 15, 2024 in the school, scientific research company, media organization hall, and railway station lounge, and Kimi program, Tongyi program, ERNIE Bot program, iFLYTEK Spark program, etc., are used as text-based generative AI programs.DiscussionThe results show that users aged 8-17 who are minors only have 6 points in their perception of the authenticity of the output content of generative artificial intelligence programs; the level of awareness of possible falsity during use reaches 4 points; the degree of user misleading is as high as 13 points.ConclusionThe study concludes that, for individuals needing special protection, such as minors, prompts should accompany every instance of content generation. For other user groups, prompts should be issued when necessary. To enhance prompt effectiveness, the program should display permanent prompts in prominent positions on the interface, using noticeable fonts and clear, well-designed wording.

The ability of these systems to simulate human capabilities such as text writing and image creation is radically redefining a wide range of practices, from artistic production to education. While there is no doubt that these innovations are beneficial to our lives, the pervasiveness of these technologies should not be underestimated, and raising increasingly pressing ethical questions that require a radical resemantization of certain notions traditionally ascribed to humans alone. Among these notions, that of technological intentionality plays a central role. With regard to this notion, this paper first aims to highlight what we propose to define in terms of the intentionality gap, whereby, insofar as, currently, (1) it is increasingly difficult to assign responsibility for the actions performed by AI systems to humans, as these systems are increasingly autonomous, and (2) it is increasingly complex to reconstruct the reasoning behind the results they produce as we move away from good old fashioned AI; it is now even more difficult to trace the intentionality of AI systems back to the intentions of the developers and end users. This gap between human and technological intentionality requires a revision of the concept of intentionality; to this end, we propose here to assign preter-intentional behavior to generative AI. We use this term to highlight how AI intentionality both incorporates and transcends human intentionality; i.e., it goes beyond (preter) human intentionality while being linked to it. To show the merits of this notion, we first rule out the possibility that such preter-intentionality is merely an unintended consequence and then explore its nature by comparing it with some paradigmatic notions of technological intentionality present in the wider debate on the moral (and technological) status of AI.}, authors = [Redaelli, Roberto],  journal = AI \& SOCIETY,  keywords = [],  title = {Intentionality gap and preter-intentionality in generative artificial intelligence}, year = {2025} }

The technologies of generative artificial intelligence have already been used by people to perform not only intellectual tasks, but also creative ones, in particular in the field of design. Therefore, their capabilities in graphic design need to be studied. One of the routine tasks of a designer is the development of corporate identity elements (a logo, font, and colour). Designers can spend a lot of time on this, choosing different style options. Therefore, delegating this routine work to generative artificial intelligence may be appropriate. With this practical need in mind, the capabilities of modern AI tools for image and logo generation were studied in the research, and the results of AI logo generation compared to the work of novice designers were analysed. As a result, conclusions were drawn about the expediency of using generative AI technology in the work of designers, in particular, for the development of corporate identity elements, and the appropriateness of studying generative artificial intelligence technology in the training of future designers. These conclusions were made on the basis of a survey of 41 experts in the field of design, information technology and artificial intelligence. Based on the findings of the survey, we can note that it was difficult for experts to distinguish between logos generated by artificial intelligence and logos created by novice designers. Logos developed by novice designers (5) were recognized as the most attractive among the 45 logos presented in the survey. Images generated in some AI tools (Tailor Brands, Hatchful) are considered attractive by design, information technology and artificial intelligence professionals. Therefore, they can be used to create corporate identity elements.

Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI.

Meanwhile, mobile services offer substantial support for accessibility, functionality and intelligence of GenAI applications. However, current research on integrating GenAI and mobile services remains nascent, lacking necessary theoretical and technical support. In this survey, we break down a new vision to guide research on integrating GenAI and mobile services, aiming to improve 6G intelligence levels and enable 6G mobile networks to support the integration of GenAI and mobile services effectively. We begin by examining the necessity of integrating GenAI with 6G mobile services and exploring potential learning architectures of GenAI models within mobile networks. Next, we analyze potential solutions from two perspectives: how 6G mobile networks empower GenAI and how GenAI enables mobile services. We subsequently explore a promising use case, along with essential features and techniques, to facilitate the integration of GenAI and mobile services.

We explore cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques called Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to predict species coexistence patterns in vegetation patches, training generative adversarial networks (GAN) and variational AutoEncoders (VAE) that are then used to unravel some of the mechanisms behind community assemblage. The GAN accurately reproduces real patches' species composition and plant species' affinity to different soil types, and the VAE also reaches a high level of accuracy, above 99\%. Using the artificially generated patches, we found that high-order interactions tend to suppress the positive effects of low-order interactions. Finally, by reconstructing successional trajectories, we could identify the pioneer species with larger potential to generate a high diversity of distinct patches in terms of species composition.

The modern Russian labor market is characterized by low unemployment, staff shortages, and intersectoral imbalances. An urgent scientific task is to model scenarios for the development of the labor market in the context of sectors, taking into account the influence of generative artificial intelligence. The aim of the work is to assess the potential impact of the mass use of generative artificial intelligence on the labor market, due to changes in labor efficiency in some professions and industries, based on the analysis of statistical and expert data and economic and mathematical modeling of possible scenarios for the development of the labor market. Economic sectors were divided into three groups depending on the rate of change in personnel needs, based on the analysis of the Beveridge curve, which shows the dependence of the level of needs on the unemployment rate. Using existing statistical data and expert assessments, we determine the degree of influence of generative artificial intelligence on labor efficiency in various industries. We put forward an approach that helps to obtain estimates of possible scenarios for the development of sectoral labor markets for the period up to 2030, based on official forecasts of ministries (Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Labor of the Russian Federation) for the period up to 2026, their extrapolation, and superimposition of the impact of mass use of generative artificial intelligence (as a disturbing effect).

As generated solutions and applications grow more complex and multi-faceted, new needs, objectives, and possibilities for explainability (XAI) have emerged. This work elaborates on why XAI has gained importance with the rise of GenAI and the challenges it poses for explainability research. We also highlight new and emerging criteria that explanations should meet, such as verifiability, interactivity, security, and cost considerations. To achieve this, we focus on surveying existing literature. Additionally, we provide a taxonomy of relevant dimensions to better characterize existing XAI mechanisms and methods for GenAI. We explore various approaches to ensure XAI, ranging from training data to prompting. Our paper provides a concise technical background of GenAI for non-technical readers, focusing on text and images to help them understand new or adapted XAI techniques for GenAI.

It examines how effectively new generative AI-based chatbots can handle customer emotions and explores their impact on determining the point at which a customer-machine interaction should be transferred to a human agent to prevent customer disengagement, referred to as the Switch Point (SP). Design/methodology/approach-To evaluate the capabilities of new generative AI-based chatbots in managing emotions, ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini and Copilot are tested using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire Short-Form (TEIQue-SF). A reference framework is developed to illustrate the shift in the Switch Point (SP). Findings-Using the four-intelligence framework (mechanical, analytical, intuitive and empathetic), this study demonstrates that, despite advancements in AI's ability to address emotions in customer service, even the most advanced chatbots-such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot-still fall short of replicating the empathetic capabilities of human intelligence (HI). The concept of artificial emotional awareness (AEA) is introduced to characterize the intuitive intelligence of new generative AI chatbots in understanding customer emotions and triggering the SP.

Personalized learning has been conceptualized for a long time, but it has only recently become realistic and truly achievable. In this paper, we propose an affordable and sustainable approach toward personalizing learning materials as part of the complete educational process. We have created a tool within a pre-existing learning management system at a software engineering college that automatically generates learning materials based on the learning outcomes provided by the professor for a particular class. The learning materials were composed in three distinct styles, the initial one being the traditional professor style and the other two variations adopting a pop-culture influence, namely Batman and Wednesday Addams. Each lesson, besides being delivered in three different formats, contained automatically generated multiple-choice questions that students could use to check their progress. This paper contains complete instructions for developing such a tool with the help of large language models using OpenAI's API and an analysis of the preliminary experiment of its usage performed with the help of 20 college students studying software engineering at a European university. Participation in the study was optional and on voluntary basis.

The results indicate that students found the multiple variants of the learning materials really engaging. While predominantly utilizing the traditional variant of the learning materials, they found this approach inspiring, would recommend it to other students, and would like to see it more in classes. The most popular feature were the automatically generated quiz-style tests that they used to assess their understanding.

By embedding alternative perceptual systems into GenAI platforms, firms can achieve novel, interactive, and personalized insights that their competitors may find difficult to replicate.

This study proposes a general pipeline to automatically quantify uncertainty within GAI. To measure uncertainty, the textual prompt to a text-to-image model is compared to captions supplied by four image-to-text models (GIT, BLIP, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP).

The generative AI models performed consistently across the metrics; however, the vector space models yielded the highest average similarity, close to 80\%, which suggests more ideal and ``certain'' results.

Although there has been qualitative research on generative artificial intelligence in other fields, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers; this study seeks to report on the topic. Objective: This study aimed to describe the experiences and perceptions of generative artificial intelligence among Chinese nurse researchers, as well as provide a reference for the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research in the future. Methods: Semistructured interviews were used to collect data in this qualitative study. Researchers mainly conducted interviews on the cognition, experience, and future expectations of nurse researchers regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence. Twenty-seven nurse researchers were included in the study. Through purposive sampling and snowball sampling, there were 7 nursing faculty researchers, 10 nursing graduate students, and 10 clinical nurse researchers. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: Five themes and 12 subthemes were categorized from 27 original interview documents as follows: (1) diverse reflections on human-machine symbiosis, which includes the interplay between substitution and assistance, researchers shaping the potential of generative artificial intelligence, and acceptance of generative artificial intelligence with alacrity; (2) multiple factors of the usage experience, including individual characteristics and various usage scenarios; (3) research paradigm reshaping in the infancy stage, which involves full-process groundbreaking assistive tools and emergence of new research paths; (4) application risks of generative artificial intelligence, including intrinsic limitations of generative artificial intelligence and academic integrity and medical ethics; and (5) the co-improvement of technology and literacy, which concerns reinforcement needs for generative artificial intelligence literacy, development of nursing research generative artificial intelligence and urgent need for artificial intelligence-generated content detection tools. In this context, the first 4 themes form the rocket of the human-machine symbiosis journey. Only when humans fully leverage the advantages of machines (generative artificial intelligence) and overcome their shortcomings can this human-machine symbiosis journey reach the correct future direction (fifth theme). Conclusions: This study explored the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers interacting with generative artificial intelligence, which was a ``symbiotic journey'' full of twists and turns, and provides a reference and basis for achieving harmonious coexistence between nurse researchers and generative artificial intelligence in the future.

Specifically, our method projects out-of-domain images into the feature space of a specific layer in the generator and designs a mechanism to enable the generator to decode that feature back to the original image as possible. Besides that, we also suggest viewing multiple layers of the model as nonlinearity associative memory and design a rewriting strategy with better performance based on this.

Existing DGM formulations are based on the assumption of a symmetric Gaussian posterior over the model latent variables. This assumption, although mathematically convenient, can be well-expected to undermine the eventually obtained representation power, as it imposes apparent expressiveness limitations. Indeed, it has been recently shown that even some moderate increase in the latent variable posterior expressiveness, obtained by introducing an additional level of dependencies upon auxiliary (Gaussian) latent variables, can result in significant performance improvements in the context of semi-supervised learning tasks. Inspired from these advances, in this paper we examine whether a more potent increase in the expressiveness and representation power of modern DGMs can be achieved by completely relaxing their typical symmetric (Gaussian) latent variable posterior assumptions: Specifically, we consider DGMs with asymmetric posteriors, formulated as restricted multivariate skew-Normal (rMSN) distributions. We derive an efficient amortized variational inference algorithm for the proposed model, and exhibit its superiority over the current state-of-the-art in several semi-supervised learning benchmarks.

It identifies the persistent factors that contributed to an accountability gap when AI systems were previously used for judicial decision-making. To address these risks, the paper analyses the relevant provisions of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, outlining a comprehensive accountability framework based on the regulation's risk-based approach. The paper concludes that the successful integration of generative LLMs in judicial decision-making requires a holistic approach addressing cognitive biases. By emphasising shared responsibility and the imperative of AI literacy across the AI value chain, the regulatory framework can help mitigate the risks of automation bias and preserve the rule of law.}, authors = [Carnat, Irina],  journal = COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW,  keywords = [],  title = {Addressing the risks of generative AI for the judiciary: The accountability framework(s) under the EU AI Act}, year = {2024} }

In this research, we demonstrate that exposure to gen-AI produced content can affect people's self-confidence at the same task through a social comparison process. Anchoring this research in the domain of creativity, we find that exposing people to creative content believed to have been created by gen-AI (vs. a human peer) increases people's self-confidence in their own relevant creative abilities. This effect emerges for jokes, stories, poetry, and visual art, and it can consequently increase people's willingness to attempt the activity-even though the greater confidence underscoring their actions might be unwarranted. We further show that these effects emerge because gen-AI is perceived as a lower social referent for creative endeavors, bolstering people's own self-perceptions. As a result, for domains in which gen-AI is perceived as an equal or greater social referent (i.e., in fact-based domains), the effects are attenuated.

Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes.}, authors = [Park, Donghwi, Park, Joonhee, Kim, Naksoo],  journal = JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES,  keywords = [],  title = {A 3D preform design method based on a generative artificial intelligence algorithm}, year = {2025} }

However, limited research has investigated how students perceive and accept these emerging technologies. This study addresses this gap by developing a scale to assess university students' attitudes toward generative AI tools in education.Methods A three-stage process was employed to develop and validate the Generative AI Attitude Scale. Data were collected from 664 students from various faculties during the 2022-2023 academic year. Expert evaluations were conducted to establish face and content validity. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on a subset of 400 participants, revealing a two-factor, 14-item structure that explained 78.440\% of the variance. A subsequent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on a separate sample of 264 students to validate this structure, resulting in the removal of one item and a final 13-item scale.Results The 13-item scale demonstrated strong reliability, evidenced by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 and a test-retest reliability of 0.90. Discriminative power was confirmed through corrected item-total correlations between lower and upper percentile groups.

DL has accomplished major success in optimizing performances connected with AI. In the financial area, it can be extremely utilized for the stock market predictive, trade implementation approaches, and set of optimizers.

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models, known for their swift production of diverse artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), stand out as a prime solution. However, integrating cloud-centric GAI models into vehicular networks is fraught with challenges. Notably, to offer specialized generative edge intelligence (EI) and boost vehicular AIGC, GAI models need to tap into user data and utilize significant computation resources. Moreover, their deployment across vehicular networks is essential for proximity-based distributed inferences. Yet, edge devices are resource-limited, and data sharing can raise safety and privacy concerns. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces GAI-IoV, an EI-enabled GAI framework facilitated through the cooperation between road-side units (RSUs) and vehicles. Subsequently, we propose the workflow for collaborative fine-tuning and distributed inference. On this basis, two pivotal vehicle-centric problems are then formulated: computation and communication resource allocation for federated fine-tuning (FFT) to optimize time and energy cost, and splitting strategy of shared and local inferences to optimize inference latency and content-generation capability. To solve these optimizations, we introduce a self-adaptive global best harmony search (SGHS) algorithm for resource allocation and a backward induction method for determining inference splitting strategy. Our experiments based on the Stable Diffusion v1-4 model vouch for a superior fine-tuning and inference capabilities of GAI-IoV. Furthermore, simulations underscore its resource utilization and distributed inference efficiency in dynamic vehicular scenarios.}, authors = [Xie, Gaochang, Xiong, Zehui, Zhang, Xinyuan, Xie, Renchao, Guo, Song, Guizani, Mohsen, Poor, H.

Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox \#1) Generative AI is a `friend' yet a `foe', (Paradox \#2) Generative AI is `capable' yet `dependent', (Paradox \#3) Generative AI is `accessible' yet `restrictive', and (Paradox \#4) Generative AI gets even `popular' when `banned' (i.e., the ``what''). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a Ragnarok that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the ``so what'').}, authors = [Lim, Weng Marc, Gunasekara, Asanka, Pallant, Jessica Leigh, Pallant, Jason Ian, Pechenkina, Ekaterina],  journal = INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION,  keywords = [],  title = {Generative AI and the future of education: Ragnarok or reformation?

To cut through the hype and understand the use of AI in innovation processes in businesses today, a large-scale survey amongst innovation managers in the USA was conducted, followed by interviews.

Furthermore, AI is used more in the development stage of the innovation process than in the idea or commercialization stages, which counters much of the existing discourse, which focuses on the idea stage.

Medical education is no exception, as generative AI has the potential to become a powerful tool. However, its practicality remains uncertain. Therefore, we investigated how generative AI is perceived among medical students and utilized within the realm of medical education. Methods: In January 2024, we conducted a study with 123 second-year medical students who had completed a physiology course and laboratory training at Gunma University, Japan. Students used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) 3.5 (OpenAI) for four tasks and evaluated its responses. A survey on the use of generative AI was also conducted. Responses from 117 participants were analyzed, excluding six non-participants. Results: Among the students, 41.9\% had used ChatGPT. The average scores for tasks 1-4 were 6.5, 4.6, 7.4, and 6.2 out of 10, respectively. Although 13\% had a negative impression, 54 students found it challenging to apply for medical purposes. However, 64.1\% expressed a willingness to continue using generative AI, provided its use extended beyond medical contexts. Conclusions: Nearly 60\% of students had never used generative AI before, which is consistent with general usage trends. Although they were impressed by the speed of generative AI responses, many students found that it lacked precision for medical studies and required additional verification.

To ascertain the efficacy of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a better comprehension of the poem's connotations and its key components.

However, the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within AIoT ecosystems remains largely unexplored. Current research predominantly addresses conventional AIoT frameworks, overlooking the innovative potential of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, Diffusion Models, Transformers, and hybrid architectures, to significantly enhance situational awareness, system optimization, operational robustness, real-time responsiveness, and adaptive decision-making in complex urban environments. AIoT systems continue to face persistent challenges, including data scarcity, poor data quality, limited adaptability, imbalanced datasets, and inadequate contextawareness. This study addresses these gaps by systematically exploring how GenAI can enhance AIoT functionalities across key domains-namely cognitive augmentation, resource efficiency, network traffic, cybersecurity, and anomaly detection-while examining their synergistic potential to improve system-level environmental performance across two interconnected layers in sustainable smart cities. At the operational layer, key findings reveal that integrating GenAI with AIoT systems enhances urban efficiency, adaptability, autonomy, robustness, and resilience by conserving resources, optimizing network traffic flows, securing infrastructures, and detecting anomalies before they escalate. Specifically, the fusion of generative intelligence with federated learning promotes sustainable, energy-efficient AIoT deployments by reducing data transmission, thereby lowering communication overhead and safeguarding user privacy. In networked environments, generative models improve synthetic traffic realism and communication efficiency. They also strengthen cybersecurity through enhanced intrusion prevention and threat detection. Additionally, they enable early identification and mitigation of anomalies, boosting operational efficiency and system robustness. These improvements stabilize sustainable smart city system functioning and prevent disruptive failures. At the environmental layer, as key findings indicate, these operational gains cascade into indirect but tangible ecological benefits, while generative models advance the core pillars of AIoT by enabling proactive, autonomous, context-aware, and self-adaptive systems that further enhance the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities. Thus, while the five domains primarily underpin the operational backbone of urban systems, their cascading effects extend to ecological outcomes. The proposed conceptual framework, distilled from key findings, integrates GenAI and AIoT and highlights both domain-specific advancements and their synergistic interactions. This framework holds significant potential to drive sustainable smart city development by fostering AIoT ecosystems that are more intelligent, resource-efficient, adaptive, secure, robust, and autonomous through the strategic application of generative intelligence.

This paper considers the problem of improving editorial and publishing processes, namely self-publishing, when designing book covers using machine learning and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) methods. When choosing a book, readers often have certain expectations regarding the design of the publication, including the color of the cover. These expectations can be called color preferences, and they can depend on the genre of the book, its target audience, and even personal associations. Cultural context can also influence color choice, as certain colors can symbolize different emotions or moods in different cultures. Cluster analysis of book cover images of the same genre allows us to identify color preferences inherent in the genre, which is proposed to be used when designing new covers. The capabilities of generative services for creating and improving cover designs are also investigated. An improved flow chart for using GAI in creating book covers in the process of self-publishing is proposed, which includes new stages, namely exploring, conditioning, and evolving. At these stages, the designer creates prompts for GAI and examines how they and GAI's issuances correspond to the task. Conditioning allows for even more precise adjustment of prompts to features of each book, and the evolving stage also includes post-processing of results already received from GAI. Post-processing, in turn, can be performed both in generative services and by a designer. The experiment allowed us to use the machine-learning method to determine which colors are most often found in book cover layouts of one of the genres and to check whether these colors correspond to harmonious color palettes. In accordance with the proposed scheme of the design process using generative artificial intelligence, versions of book cover layouts of a given genre were obtained.}, authors = [Kulishova, Nonna, Sajek, Daiva],  journal = JOURNAL OF IMAGING,  keywords = [],  title = {Using Machine Learning and Generative Intelligence in Book Cover Development}, year = {2025} }

While studies have examined the effect of these tools on the experience of attending physicians, little evidence is available regarding their use by resident physician trainees. Objectives To assess trainee experience with an ambient artificial intelligence scribe using measures of usability, acceptability, and documentation burden. Methods This prospective observational study enrolled 47 trainees in a 2-month pilot. Pre/postsurveys were conducted with the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX, raw unweighted form, pre/post, for cognitive load during the documentation), the System Usability Scale (post; general usability), the Net Promoter Score (post; acceptability), and the AMIA TrendBurden Survey (pre/post; documentation burden). Electronic health record utilization metrics were obtained from Epic Signal for both the pilot period and a 6-month baseline. Results In total, 43/47 (91.5\%) of participants adopted the intervention in practice. NASA-TLX scores improved from 56.3 to 43.3 (p < 0.001), and multiple items on the TrendBurden survey improved with high measures of acceptability.

Although repeatedly questioned by many critics per se value-neutral generative AI stands a good chance of becoming an important tool for presenting chemical information throughout all strata of society. Additionally, it can support the spread of science-based opinions on chemistry to the public and help popularize science in general as well. AI allows virtually every scientist to become a major player in science communication. This could lead to a containment of chemophobia. However, the use of AI as a communication tool requires continuous education, personal development and training of those who use it, in this case chemists and scientists in general. They will play a crucial role as arbiters of the appropriateness, adequacy and factual accuracy of the content generated by generative AI. The democratization of communication made possible by generative AI entails the need to adapt the dialogue to the communication preferences, demography and education of the interlocutors. Thus, generative AI empowers both those who enter the prompts and those who receive the subsequent results. Most scientists do not realize it, but generative AI puts the public, not scientists, at the center of communication. It is important to recognize this and use generative AI to target communication, education, and overall community development. The clash of narratives that may be a natural consequence of the growing number of generative AI users and the increasing amount of content being created may, perhaps unexpectedly for many, lead to the opposite result - a new Enlightenment.

Several studies assessed its efficacy in improving medical studies learning, and others assessed medical students' knowledge and attitudes about generative AI. So, we aim to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of generative AI among medical students in Egypt. Methods In 2024, a cross-sectional study using a semi-structured questionnaire was performed, targeting 423 students as a convenient sample from 10 selected Egyptian universities by simple random sampling. The questionnaire was distributed via online platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, X, Telegram, and Messenger. Data about sociodemographic characteristics, students' general knowledge about generative AI and its limitations, and their attitudes and practices, respectively, were collected. Results About 23 (61.5\%) of the studied students had satisfactory knowledge about generative AI and (44.7\%) had a positive attitude. Males demonstrated significantly higher knowledge than females (69.3\% vs. 55\%, P-value = 0.003). Knowledge level also differs significantly by university (P-value < 0.001), with Suez-Canal and 6th October university students achieving the highest satisfactory scores. Key significant predictors that affect knowledge level include gender, university and study phase according to binary logistic regression results. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between satisfactory knowledge and Practice level (r = 0.303, P < 0.001). Finally, most students use generative AI to check Grammar and prepare their homework or assignments.

This paper examines the opportunities that GAI offers specifically for additive manufacturing. There are currently relatively few publications that deal with the topic of GAI in AM. Much of the information has only been published in preprints. There, the focus has been on algorithms for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

The regression analysis indicated that the Guide Contextualization Strategy had a greater impact on response quality, reinforcing the importance of contextual information in effective interactions with large language models. As an exploratory study, these findings provide preliminary evidence on prompt engineering strategies in Spanish, a relatively unexplored area in artificial intelligence education research. Based on these results, a methodological framework is proposed, encompassing four key dimensions: grammatical skills; prompt strategies; response from the large language model; and evaluation of response quality. This framework lays the groundwork for future artificial intelligence digital literacy interventions, fostering critical and effective engagement with generative artificial intelligence while also highlighting the need for further research to validate and expand these initial insights.}, authors = [Carrasco-Saez, Jose Luis, Contreras-Saavedra, Carolina, San-Martin-Quiroga, Sheny, Contreras-Saavedra, Carla E., Viveros-Munoz, Rhoddy],  journal = APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,  keywords = [],  title = {Analyzing Higher Education Students' Prompting Techniques and Their Impact on ChatGPT's Performance: An Exploratory Study in Spanish}, year = {2025} }
